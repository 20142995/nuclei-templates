id: CVE-2017-1000353

info:
  name: Jenkins Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: critical
  description: Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier are vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution. An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability allowed attackers to transfer a serialized Java `SignedObject` object to the Jenkins CLI, that would be deserialized using a new `ObjectInputStream`, bypassing the existing blacklist-based protection mechanism.
  impact: |
    An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins server without authentication.
  remediation: |
    Apply the official patch provided by Jenkins to fix the vulnerability.

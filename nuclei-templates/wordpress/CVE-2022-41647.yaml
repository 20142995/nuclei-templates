    Optinly <= 1.0.18 - Missing Authorization to Plugin Settings Change
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Optinly  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.0.18. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to change certain plugin settings.

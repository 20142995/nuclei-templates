    WP Post Author â€“ Enhance Your Posts with the Author Bio, Co-Authors, Guest Authors, and Post Rating System, including User Registration Form Builder <= 3.7.4 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Post Author plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the awpa_pro_api_post_rating_review() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to leave reviews on private posts.

    SurveyJS: Drag & Drop WordPress Form Builder to create, style and embed multiple forms of any complexity <= 1.12.17 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Deletion via SurveyJS_DeleteFile
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The SurveyJS: Drag & Drop WordPress Form Builder to create, style and embed multiple forms of any complexity plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to a missing capability check on the callback function of the SurveyJS_DeleteFile class in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.17. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This function is still vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery as of 1.12.20.

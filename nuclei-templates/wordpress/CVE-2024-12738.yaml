    User Profile Builder – Beautiful User Registration Forms, User Profiles & User Role Editor <= 3.12.9 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The User Profile Builder – Beautiful User Registration Forms, User Profiles & User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several user meta parameters in all versions up to, and including, 3.12.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page and clicks a link to show user meta.

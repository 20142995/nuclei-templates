    SupportCandy – Helpdesk & Support Ticket System <= 2.2.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The SupportCandy – Helpdesk & Support Ticket System WordPress plugin before 2.2.7 does not have CSRF check in the wpsc_tickets AJAX action, nor has any sanitisation or escaping in some of the filter fields which could allow attackers to make a logged in user having access to the ticket lists dashboard set an arbitrary filter (stored in their cookies) with an XSS payload in it.

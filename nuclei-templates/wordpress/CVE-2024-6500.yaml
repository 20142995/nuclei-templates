  name: >
    InPost for WooCommerce <= 1.4.0 and InPost PL <= 1.4.4 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read and Delete
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The InPost for WooCommerce plugin and InPost PL plugin for WordPress are vulnerable to unauthorized access and deletion of data due to a missing capability check on the 'parse_request' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.0 (for InPost for WooCommerce) as well as 1.4.4 (for InPost PL). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read and delete arbitrary files on Windows servers. On Linux servers, only files within the WordPress install will be deleted, but all files can be read.

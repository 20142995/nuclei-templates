  name: >
    Indeed Job Importer  <= 1.0.5 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Indeed Job Importer WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters found in the ~/indeed-job-importer/trunk/indeed-job-importer.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.0.5. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.

  name: >
    Theme Builder For Elementor <= 1.2.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Post Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Theme Builder For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2 via the 'elementor-template' shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts created by Elementor that they should not have access to.

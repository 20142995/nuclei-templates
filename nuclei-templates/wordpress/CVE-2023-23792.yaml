  name: >
    Swatchly – WooCommerce Variation Swatches for Products <= 1.2.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via plugin_activation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Swatchly – WooCommerce Variation Swatches for Products plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the plugin_activation() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    Quotes llama <= 0.7 - Authenticated (Admin+) Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Quotes llama WordPress plugin through 0.7 does not sanitise and escape Quotes, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered_html is disallowed. The attack could also be performed by tricking an admin to import a malicious CSV file

  description: >
    The Website Builder by SeedProd â€” Theme Builder, Landing Page Builder, Coming Soon Page, Maintenance Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 6.17.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

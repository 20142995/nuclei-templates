info:
  name: >
    WP-Mobile-BankID-Integration <= 1.0.0 - PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WP-Mobile-BankID-Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and excluding, 1.0.1 via deserialization of untrusted input through the getAuthResponseFromDB function. This makes it possible for attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.

    WPS Cleaner <= 1.4.4 - Missing Authorization Checks
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WPS Cleaner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.4.4. This is due to missing capability and nonce checks on 7 different functions found in the '/classes/plugin.php' file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to perform a variety of actions such as deleting arbitrary files, creating zip archives, deleting zip archives, and deleting alerts among some additional actions.

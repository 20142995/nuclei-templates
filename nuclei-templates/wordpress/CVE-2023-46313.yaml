  name: >
    Zotpress <= 7.3.4 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via 'PHP_SELF'
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Zotpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via 'PHP_SELF' in versions up to, and including, 7.3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. On certain configurations including Apache+modPHP, this makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

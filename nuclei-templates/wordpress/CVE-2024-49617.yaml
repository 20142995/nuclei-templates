info:
  name: >
    Back Link Tracker <= 1.0.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Back Link Tracker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious SQL used in a query granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Due to their inability to obtain a query response, the exploitation opportunities are limited.

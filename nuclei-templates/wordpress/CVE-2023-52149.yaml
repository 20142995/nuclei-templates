  name: >
    Floating Button <= 6.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via process_bulk_action
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Floating Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the process_bulk_action function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to process bulk actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

    Booster for WooCommerce <= 5.6.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Booster for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.6.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several different functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform several administrative actions like adding VAT rates, saving metaboxes, importing settings and more via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

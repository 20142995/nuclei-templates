    Event Tickets with Ticket Scanner <= 1.5.4 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Event Tickets with Ticket Scanner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting  in versions up to, and including, 1.5.4 via the 'data[codes]' parameter saved through the 'sasoEventtickets_executeAdminSettings' AJAX action, due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

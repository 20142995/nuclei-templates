info:
  name: >
    Welcart e-Commerce <= 2.9.4 - Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.4 via deserialization of untrusted input from a cookie in this plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.

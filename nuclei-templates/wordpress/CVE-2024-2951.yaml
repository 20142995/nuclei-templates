    RegistrationMagic <= 5.3.0.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The RegistrationMagic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.3.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

info:
  name: >
    Plugin Groups <= 2.0.6 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Denial of Service
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Plugin Groups plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the admin_init() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the settings of the plugin, which can also cause a denial of service due to a misconfiguration.

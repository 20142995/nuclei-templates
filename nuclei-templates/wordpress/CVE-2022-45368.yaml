  name: >
    1003 Mortgage Application <= 1.75 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Download
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The 1003 Mortgage Application plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file download in versions up to, and including, 1.75 due to incorrect controls on the mortgate_application_download_file_callback() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access or higher to download arbitrary files on the affected site's server, including database configuration files.

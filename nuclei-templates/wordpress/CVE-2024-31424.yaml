info:
  name: >
    Login with phone number <= 1.6.93 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.93. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the lwp_forgot_password() and lwp_update_password_action() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update other users passwords via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

    Fatcat Apps Analytics Cat <= 1.0.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Fatcat Apps Analytics Cat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the fca_ga_settings_page function . This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

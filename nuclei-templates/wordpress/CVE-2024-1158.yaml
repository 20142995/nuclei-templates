  description: >
    The Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the buddyforms_new_page function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.7.

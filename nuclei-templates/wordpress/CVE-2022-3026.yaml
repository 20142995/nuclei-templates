id: CVE-2022-3026

info:
  name: >
    WP Users Exporter <= 1.4.2 - CSV Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Users Exporter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.4.2 via the 'Export Users' functionality. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, such as a subscriber, to add untrusted input into profile information like First Names that will embed into the exported CSV file triggered by an administrator and can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.

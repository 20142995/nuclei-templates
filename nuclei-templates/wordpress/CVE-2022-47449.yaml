    Cart Lift – Abandoned Cart Recovery for WooCommerce and EDD <= 3.1.5 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via cart_search
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Cart Lift – Abandoned Cart Recovery for WooCommerce and EDD plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'cart_search' parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

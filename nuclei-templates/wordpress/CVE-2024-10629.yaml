info:
  name: >
    GPX Viewer <= 2.2.8 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The GPX Viewer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file creation due to a missing capability check and file type validation in the gpxv_file_upload() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

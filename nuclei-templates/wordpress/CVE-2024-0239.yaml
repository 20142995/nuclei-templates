    Contact Form 7 Connector <= 1.2.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Contact Form 7 Connector plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on various functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute JavaScript in a victims browser via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

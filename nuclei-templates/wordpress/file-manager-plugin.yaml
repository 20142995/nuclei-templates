    Bit File Manager <= 4.1.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Bit File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the plugin's upload form. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files to the server via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

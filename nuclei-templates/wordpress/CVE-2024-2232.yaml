  name: >
    Himer - Social Questions and Answers <= 2.1.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary User Invites
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Himer theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpqa_add_group_user AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send user invites to private groups via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

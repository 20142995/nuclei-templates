  name: >
    Contest Gallery <= 24.0.7 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Password Reset to Privilege Escalation/Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Contest Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 24.0.7. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.

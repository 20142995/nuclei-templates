    GG Woo Feed for WooCommerce Shopping Feed <= 1.2.6 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The GG Woo Feed for WooCommerce Shopping Feed on Google Facebook and Other Channels plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to missing capability checks on several functions in the /inc/Core/ajax-functions.php file in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform several unauthorized actions.

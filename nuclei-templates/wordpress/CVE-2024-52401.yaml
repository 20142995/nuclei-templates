  name: >
    Hacklog DownloadManager <= 2.1.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Hacklog DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    RB Internal Links <= 2.0.16 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings update and Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The RB Internal Links WordPress plugin through 2.0.16 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack, as well as perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping

  name: >
    Download IP2Location Country Blocker <= 2.29.1 - Bypass via IP Spoofing
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Download IP2Location Country Blocker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in versions up to, and including, 2.29.1. This is due to insufficient restrictions on where the IP Address information is being retrieved for request logging and access restrictions. Attackers can supply the X-Real-IP or X-Forwarded-For header with a different IP Address that will be logged and can be used to bypass settings that may have blocked out an IP address from accessing a page on the site.

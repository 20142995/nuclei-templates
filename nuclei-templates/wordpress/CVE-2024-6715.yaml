  name: >
    Ditty 3.1.39 - 3.1.45 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Ditty â€“ Responsive News Tickers, Sliders, and Lists plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Content Title' field in versions 3.1.39 to 3.1.45 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This was previously patched as CVE-2024-3939 and was recently reintroduced.

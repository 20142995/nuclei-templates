  name: >
    PlugVersions – Easily rollback to previous versions of your plugins <= 0.0.7 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The PlugVersions – Easily rollback to previous versions of your plugins plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a missing capability check on the eos_plugin_reviews_restore_version() function in all versions up to, and including, 0.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary files leveraging files included locally.

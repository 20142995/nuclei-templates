  name: >
    Brands for WooCommerce <= 3.8.2.2 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Order Manipulation and Information Retrieval
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Brands for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in versions up to, and including, 3.8.2.2. This is due to missing capability checks on the clear_cache_ajax, save_order, br_get_products, br_get_brands, and save_all_orders functions hooked via AJAX nopriv actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify orders and clear the plugin's cache. Please note that while the plugin author only added nonces to the functions, and not capability checks, the nonces are not disclosed to unauthorized users making this issue patched, though not perfectly.

id: CVE-2022-1393

info:
  name: >
    WP Subtitle <= 3.4 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Subtitle WordPress plugin before 3.4.1 adds a subtitle field and provides a shortcode to display it via [wp_subtitle]. The subtitle is stored as a custom post meta with the key: "wps_subtitle", which is sanitized upon post save/update, however is not sanitized when updating it directly from the post meta update button (via AJAX) - and this makes the XSS exploitable by authenticated users with a role as low as contributor.

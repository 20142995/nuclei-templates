info:
  name: >
    Indeed Membership Pro <= 12.6 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Indeed Membership Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 12.6. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting access to functionality that allows privilege assignment. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain access to accounts that have higher privileges, such as administrator.

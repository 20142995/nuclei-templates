  name: >
    StreamCast <= 2.2.3 - Authenticated (Editor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The StreamCast â€“ Radio Player for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

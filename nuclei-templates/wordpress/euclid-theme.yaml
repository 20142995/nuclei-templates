    Euclid <= All Versions - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Euclid Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the upload-handler function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    WP Google Maps <= 9.0.27 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via REST API
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the REST API in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.27 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

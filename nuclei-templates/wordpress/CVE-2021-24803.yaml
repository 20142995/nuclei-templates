    Core Tweaks WP Setup <= 4.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Core Tweaks WP Setup WordPress plugin through 4.1 allows to bulk-set many settings in WordPress, including the admin email, as well as creating a new admin account. There is no CSRF protection in place, allowing an attacker to arbitrary change the admin email or create another admin account and takeover the website via CSRF attacks

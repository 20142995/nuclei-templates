    Easy PayPal Buy Now Button <= 1.7.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Easy PayPal Buy Now Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.7.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpecpp_settingsoptions function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious JavaScript, that will execute whenever a user accesses the /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-ecommerce-setting page, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

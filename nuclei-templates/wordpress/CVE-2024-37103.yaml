info:
  name: >
    Education Zone <= 1.3.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Notice Dismissal
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Education Zone theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the education_zone_update_admin_notice() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

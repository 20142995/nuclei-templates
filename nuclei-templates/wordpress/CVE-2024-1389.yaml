  name: >
    Paid Membership Subscriptions – Effortless Memberships, Recurring Payments & Content Restriction <= 2.11.1 - Missing Authorization via pms_stripe_connect_handle_authorization_return
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Paid Membership Subscriptions – Effortless Memberships, Recurring Payments & Content Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the pms_stripe_connect_handle_authorization_return function in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the Stripe payment keys.

  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Backup and Restore WordPress – Backup Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several functions in versions up to, and including, 1.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to trigger manual backups. The attackers can download these backups via the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-9012.

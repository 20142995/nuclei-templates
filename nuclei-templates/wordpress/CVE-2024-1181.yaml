info:
  name: >
    Coming Soon, Under Construction & Maintenance Mode By Dazzler <= 2.1.2 - Maintenance Mode Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Coming Soon, Under Construction & Maintenance Mode By Dazzler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to maintenance mode bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This is due to the plugin relying on the REQUEST_URI to determine if the page being accesses is an admin area.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass maintenance mode and access the site which may be considered confidential when in maintenance mode.

  name: >
    Multi Step Form <= 1.7.12 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Multi Step Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.12. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the menu() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to duplicate, edit, and delete forms via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

    WPLMS < 1.9.9.5.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WPLMS Learning Management System for WordPress, WordPress LMS theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in in all versions up to 1.9.9.5.2 (exclusive). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).

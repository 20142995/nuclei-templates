    Awesome Event Booking <= 2.7.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Awesome Event Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.7.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

info:
  name: >
    VikRentCar Car Rental Management System <= 1.3.0 - Authenticated (Admin+) Cross Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The VikRentCar Car Rental Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.3.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with admin-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.Â This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

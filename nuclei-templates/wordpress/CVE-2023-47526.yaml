  name: >
    Chartify <= 2.0.6 - Authenticated(Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Chartify â€“ WordPress Chart Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

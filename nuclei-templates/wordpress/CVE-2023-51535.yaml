info:
  name: >
    Spam protection, AntiSpam, FireWall by CleanTalk <= 6.20 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Spam protection, AntiSpam, FireWall by CleanTalk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.20. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the apbct_admin__admin_bar__prepare_counters() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to prepare counters via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

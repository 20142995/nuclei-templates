info:
  name: >
    Five Star Restaurant Menu and Food Ordering <= 2.4.10 - Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Five Star Restaurant Menu and Food Ordering plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.10 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'options' parameter supplied via the 'fdm_update_cart_item' AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.

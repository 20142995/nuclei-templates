  name: >
    Joli Table of Contents <= 1.3.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Joli Table of Contents plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the jtocHandleNotice() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the status of notices via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    Photo Gallery, Sliders, Proofing and Themes – NextGEN Gallery <= 3.59.2 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Gallery
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Photo Gallery, Sliders, Proofing and Themes – NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Gallery settings in all versions up to, and including, 3.59.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

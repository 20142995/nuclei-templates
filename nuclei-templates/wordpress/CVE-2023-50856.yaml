  name: >
    Funnel Builder for WordPress by FunnelKit <= 2.14.3 - Authenticated(Administrator+) SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Funnel Builder for WordPress by FunnelKit â€“ Customize WooCommerce Checkout Pages, Create Sales Funnels & Maximize Profits plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in all versions up to 2.14.4 (exclusive) due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

  name: >
    Restaurant Menu and Food Ordering by Five Star Plugins <= 2.4.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via maybe_duplicate_item
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Restaurant Menu and Food Ordering by Five Star Plugins plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'maybe_duplicate_item' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to duplicate menu items via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

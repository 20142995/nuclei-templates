    Make Paths Relative <= 1.3.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via 'admin/class-make-paths-relative-admin.php'
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Make Paths Relative plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the admin menu functions in 'admin/class-make-paths-relative-admin.php'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

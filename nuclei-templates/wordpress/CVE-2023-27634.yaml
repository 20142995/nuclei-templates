  name: >
    Intrepidity <= 1.5.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via mytheme_add_admin
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Intrepidity theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the mytheme_add_admin function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload files and update options via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

info:
  name: >
    Funnelforms Free <= 3.4 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Post Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Funnelforms Free plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the fnsf_delete_posts function in versions up to, and including, 3.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete arbitrary posts, including administrator posts, and posts not related to the Funnelforms Free plugin.  CVE-2023-5990 appears to be a duplicate of this issue.

    B Slider- Gutenberg Slider Block for WP <= 1.1.23 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Private Post Disclosure via bsb-slider Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The B Slider- Gutenberg Slider Block for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.5 via the 'bsb-slider' shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private posts that they should not have access to.

  name: >
    Avada Builder <= 3.11.12 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Protected Post Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Avada (Fusion) Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.11.12 via the handle_clone_post() function and the 'fusion_blog' shortcode and due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to extract data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.

  name: >
    WP EasyCart <= 5.4.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via process_bulk_deactivate_product
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP EasyCart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.4.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the process_bulk_deactivate_product function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bulk deactivate products via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

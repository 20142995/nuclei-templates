  name: >
    vSlider Multi Image Slider <= 4.1.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The vSlider Multi Image Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.1.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on several functions such as vslider_admin_callback, vslider_images_callback, and vslider_generate_images_callback. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings, retrieve settings, and manipulate sliders via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    WPAdmin AWS CDN <= 2.0.13 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WPAdmin AWS CDN plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.13. This is due to missing nonce validation on several functions called via AJAX actions in the /admin/class-aws-cdn-admin.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform several unauthorized actions like managing cdn, certificate, domain, and exclusion settings for the plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

    W2S – Migrate WooCommerce to Shopify <= 1.2.1 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Read
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The W2S – Migrate WooCommerce to Shopify plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1 via the 'viw2s_view_log' AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.

    WP Business intelligence lite < 1.3 - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WP Business intelligence lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'ofc_upload_image.php' files in versions before 1.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.

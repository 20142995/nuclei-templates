  name: >
    Cost Calculator Builder <= 3.2.42 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Cost Calculator Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.42. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_settings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    User Submitted Posts <= 20230902 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The User Submitted Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the usp_attach_images function  in versions up to, and including, 20230902. This makes it possible for unauthenticatedattackers to upload arbitrary files as long as the extension does not contain 'php' on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

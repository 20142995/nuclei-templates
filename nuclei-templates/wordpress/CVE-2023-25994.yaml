info:
  name: >
    Publish to Schedule <= 4.4.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to Plugin Option Changes
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Publish to Schedule plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.4.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'pts_options_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update and view any of the plugin options via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

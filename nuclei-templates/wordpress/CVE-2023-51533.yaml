  name: >
    Ecwid Ecommerce Shopping Cart <= 6.12.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Ecwid Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.12.4. This is due to missing nonce validation on several functions hooked via AJAX in the ~/includes/class-ecwid-admin-storefront-page.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify several of the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. 	CVE-2023-6292 may be a duplicate of this issue.

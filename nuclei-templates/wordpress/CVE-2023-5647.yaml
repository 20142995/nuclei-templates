    AI ChatBot 4.9.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Deletion via qcld_openai_delete_training_file
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The AI ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Deletion in version 4.9.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber privileges to delete arbitrary files on the server, which makes it possible to take over affected sites as well as others sharing the same hosting account. This vulnerability is the same as CVE-2023-5212 but was accidentally reintroduced in version 4.9.2.

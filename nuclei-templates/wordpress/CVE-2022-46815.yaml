    Conditional Shipping for WooCommerce <= 2.3.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Conditional Shipping for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.3.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the toggle_ruleset function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

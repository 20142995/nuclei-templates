info:
  name: >
    Essential Real Estate <= 4.3.5 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Essential Real Estate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation on the 'ajaxUploadFonts' function in versions up to, and including, 4.3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level capabilities or above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. CVE-2023-6140 appears to be a duplicate of this issue.

  name: >
    MyBB Cross-Poster <= 1.0 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The MyBB Cross-Poster WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters found in the ~/classes/MyBBXPSettings.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.0. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.

  name: >
    WP Time Slots Booking Form <= 1.1.76 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Feedback Submission
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Time Slots Booking Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.76. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the cptslotsb_feedback function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to submit plugin feedback on behalf of the site owner via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

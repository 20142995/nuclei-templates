info:
  name: >
    Smart Post Show <= 3.0.0 - Authenticated (Editor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Pagination Color
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Smart Post Show plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Pagination Color setting in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

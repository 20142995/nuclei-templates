  name: >
    WP Open Street Map <= 1.25 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via wp_openstreetmaps
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Open Street Map plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.25. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_openstreetmaps function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit or delete maps via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

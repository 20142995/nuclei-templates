    Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce <= 1.0.8 - Missing Authorization in upload and delete_file
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the upload and delete_file functions in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions, to perform an unauthorized file upload or delete files.

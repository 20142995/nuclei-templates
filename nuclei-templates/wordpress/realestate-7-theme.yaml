    Real Estate 7 <= 3.3.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Real Estate 7 theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.3.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several of its AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: "InPost Gallery <= 2.1.2 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The InPost Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'admin_thumb_width' parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."

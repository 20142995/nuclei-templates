  name: >
    WordPress Books Gallery <= 4.4.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to Plugin Settings Changes
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WordPress Books Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.4.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'wbg-api-import.php' file and the functions 'wbg_gallery_settings', 'wbg_search_panel_settings', and 'wbg_details_settings'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

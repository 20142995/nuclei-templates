    Mortgage Calculators WP < 1.53 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Mortgage Calculators WP WordPress plugin before 1.53 does not implement any sanitisation on the color setting of the background of a calculator, which could allow high privilege users to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.

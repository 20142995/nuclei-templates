  name: >
    Paid Member Subscriptions <= 2.10.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via ajax_add_log_entry
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Paid Member Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.10.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_add_log_entry function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify log entries via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

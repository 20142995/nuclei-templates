id: CVE-2022-3911

info:
  name: >
    iubenda <= 3.3.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The ubenda plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in versions up to, and including, 3.3.2. This is due to missing verification in the 'process_actions' and 'ajax_save_options' functions (among numerous others). This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to perform ajax actions (such as updating plugin options) that are normally only available to higher-level authenticated users.  This can include granting new privileges to ones own account.

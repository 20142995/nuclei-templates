  name: >
    WP Cleanfix <= 5.6.2 - Missing Authorization via register
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Cleanfix plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the register function in versions up to, and including, 5.6.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to find and replace post, comment, and postmeta content as well as compacting the database.

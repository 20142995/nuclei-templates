info:
  name: >
    Tabs – Responsive Tabs with WooCommerce Product Tab Extension <= 3.6.0 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary Options Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Tabs – Responsive Tabs with WooCommerce Product Tab Extension plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary options updates in versions up to, and including, 3.6.8. This is due to a lack of validation on the settings supplied to the post_oxi_settings() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative level permissions, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This would only affect sites where the administrator has been restricted to not 'manage_options' or the administrator has allowed users with lower permissions to update the plugin's settings.

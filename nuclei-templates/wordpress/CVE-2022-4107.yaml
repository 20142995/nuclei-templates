    SMSA Shipping for WooCommerce <= 1.0.4 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Download
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The SMSA Shipping for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Download due to missing file validation on file download functionality in versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers with any file download functionality to access and download any arbitrary file on the server, including database configuration files.

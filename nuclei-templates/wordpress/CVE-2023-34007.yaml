info:
  name: >
    Download Monitor <= 4.8.3 - Authenticated(Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload via upload_file
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Download Monitor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation and access controls on the 'upload_file' function in versions up to, and including, 4.8.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level capabilities or above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

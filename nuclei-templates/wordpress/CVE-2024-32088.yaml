    Coming Soon Page, Under Construction & Maintenance Mode by SeedProd <= 6.15.20 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Notice Dismissal
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Coming Soon Page, Under Construction & Maintenance Mode by SeedProd plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.15.20. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the seedprod_lite_redirect_to_site() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    YourChannel <= 1.2.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Plugin Channel Reset
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The YourChannel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the clearKeys function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's channel settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

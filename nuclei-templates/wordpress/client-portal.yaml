  name: "Client Portal <= 1.1.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via cp_create_private_pages_for_all_users"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Client Portal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.8. This is due to missing nonce validation on the cp_create_private_pages_for_all_users function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate private pages for all users, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

id: CVE-2023-25056

info:
  name: >
    Feed Them Social <= 3.0.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Feed Them Social plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.0.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the following functions: fts_maybe_set_transient, fts_check_nag_get, feed_them_settings, social_follow_button, fts_facebook_page_form, fts_twitter_form, fts_instagram_form, fts_youtube_form, and fts_pinterest_form. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

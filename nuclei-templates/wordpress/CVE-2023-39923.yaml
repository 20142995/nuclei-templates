info:
  name: >
    The Post Grid <= 7.2.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The The Post Grid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.2.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_block_css() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify block CSS via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

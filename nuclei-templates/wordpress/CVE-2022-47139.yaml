  name: >
    WP Basic Elements <= 5.2.15 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via wpbe_save_settings
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Basic Elements plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.2.15. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpbe_save_settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

info:
  name: >
    Recently viewed and most viewed products <= 1.1.1 - Authenticated (Shop Manager+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Recently viewed and most viewed products plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via an unknown parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

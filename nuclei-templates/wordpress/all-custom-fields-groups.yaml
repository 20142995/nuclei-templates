  name: "All custom fields & groups <= 1.04 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The All custom fields & groups plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.04 due to the use of add_query_arg/remove_query_arg with insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages via a URL that executes if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

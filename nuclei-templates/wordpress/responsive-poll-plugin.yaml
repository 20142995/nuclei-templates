    Responsive Poll < 1.7.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Responsive Poll plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting in versions before 1.7.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping and missing nonce validation. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

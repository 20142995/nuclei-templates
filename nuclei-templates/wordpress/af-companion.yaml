  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The AF Companion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions 1.1.0 to 1.1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the aftc_install_activate_plugins action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to enable or disable arbitrary plugins via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

info:
  name: >
    Insight Core <= 1.0 - Authenticated PHP Object Injection & Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Insight Core WordPress plugin through 1.0 does not have any authorisation and CSRF checks in the insight_customizer_options_import (available to any authenticated user), does not validate user input before passing it to unserialize(), nor sanitise and escape it before outputting it in the response. As a result, it could allow users with a role as low as Subscriber to perform PHP Object Injection, as well as Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

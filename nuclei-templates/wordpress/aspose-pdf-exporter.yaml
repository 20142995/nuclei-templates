  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "The Aspose.PDF Exporter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Download in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to insufficient input sanitization of the 'file' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download any file, including configuration files."

  name: >
    Full Screen Menu for Elementor <= 1.0.7 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Post Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Full Screen Menu for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7 via the  Full Screen Menu Elementor Widget due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts created with Elementor that they should not have access to.

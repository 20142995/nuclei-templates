info:
  name: >
    Photo Gallery by 10Web <= 1.8.27 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Photo Gallery by 10Web plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.8.27 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. CVE-2024-5968 may be a duplicate of this issue.

    WP Statistics <= 12.6.6.1 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via IP Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Statistics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via IP spoofing in versions up to, and including, [up to affected version] due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for [authentication-level] attackers [inject user-level requirements if available and authentication is required] to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

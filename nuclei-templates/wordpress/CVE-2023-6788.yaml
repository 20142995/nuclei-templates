  name: >
    Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder <= 3.8.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the contents function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the options "mf_hubsopt_token", "mf_hubsopt_refresh_token", "mf_hubsopt_token_type", and "mf_hubsopt_expires_in" via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would allow an attacker to connect their own Hubspot account to a victim site's metform to obtain leads and contacts.

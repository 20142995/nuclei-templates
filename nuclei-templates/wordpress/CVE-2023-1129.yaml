  name: >
    WP FEvents Book <= 0.46 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Insecure Direct Object Reference to Booking Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP FEvents Book plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data, modification of data, and loss of data due to insufficient controls on the userID controlled via the showform_fevent6 function in versions up to, and including, 0.46. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to manipulate booking data for any user.

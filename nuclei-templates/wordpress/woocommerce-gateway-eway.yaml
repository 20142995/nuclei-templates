    WooCommerce Eway Gateway <= 3.5.0 - Insecure Direct Object Reference
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Eway Gateway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to insecure direct object reference in versions up to, and including, 3.5.0. This is due to insufficient validation on the 'order' user-controlled key. This ensures that subscriptions are paid for by the subscriber as opposed to another user.

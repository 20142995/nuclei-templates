info:
  name: >
    RS-Members <= 1.0.3 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The RS-Members plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting what roles a user can be assigned to. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to escalate their privileges to that of an administrator.

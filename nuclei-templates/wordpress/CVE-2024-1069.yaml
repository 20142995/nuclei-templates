info:
  name: >
    Contact Form Entries <= 1.3.2 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Contact Form Entries plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file validation on the 'view_page' function in versions up to, and including, 1.3.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level capabilities or above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

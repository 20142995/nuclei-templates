  name: >
    WP2LEADS <= 3.2.7 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP2LEADS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on several functions such as import_maps in versions up to, and including, 3.2.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform several unauthorized actions.

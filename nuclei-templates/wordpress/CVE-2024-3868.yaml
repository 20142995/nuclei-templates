info:
  name: >
    Folders Pro <= 3.0.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via User First Name and Last Name
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Folders Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a user's First Name and Last Name in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

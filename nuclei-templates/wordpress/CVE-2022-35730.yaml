    Oceanwp sticky header <= 1.0.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Plugin Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Oceanwp sticky header plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the settings_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the plugin's style settings, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

info:
  name: >
    Product Catalog Feed by PixelYourSite <= 2.1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Product Catalog Feed by PixelYourSite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the set_disable_status(), set_wpwoof_schedule() and check_feed_name() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to control plugin functionality via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    WPQA Builder <= 6.1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WPQA Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

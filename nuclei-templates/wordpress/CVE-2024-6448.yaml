info:
  name: >
    Mollie Payments for WooCommerce <= 7.7.0 -  Unauthenticated Full Path Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Mollie Payments for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information exposure in all versions up to, and including, 7.7.0. This is due to the error reporting being enabled by default in multiple plugin files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain the full path to instances, which they may be able to use in combination with other vulnerabilities or to simplify reconnaissance work. On its own, this information is of very limited use.

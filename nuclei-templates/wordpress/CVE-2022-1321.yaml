  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The miniOrange's Google Authenticator plugin for WordPress vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘Add Referer’ field in versions up to, and including, 5.5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative capabilities to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html have been disabled.

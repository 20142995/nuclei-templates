info:
  name: >
    Pro Mime Types <= 1.0.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Pro Mime Types plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This is due to missing nonce validation on the pmt_settings_section_callback_tab_1() function used to control the plugin's settings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable and disable MIME-type support via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

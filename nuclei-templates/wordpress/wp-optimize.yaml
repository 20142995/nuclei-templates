  name: "WP-Optimize <= 3.2.11 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WP-Optimize plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.2.11. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'is_valid_request' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manage and modify cache and minification settings and dismiss notifications via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

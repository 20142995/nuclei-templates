info:
  name: >
    WP Directorybox Manager <= 2.5 - Authentication Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WP Directorybox Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.5. This is due to incorrect authentication in the 'wp_dp_enquiry_agent_contact_form_submit_callback' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username.

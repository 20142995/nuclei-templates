    Theme Editor <= 2.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Theme Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the [function-name] function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to [state the impact of the vulnerability] via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    Advanced Category Template <= 0.1 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Cross-Site Request Forgery in _form.php
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Advanced Category Template plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the _form.php file in versions up to, and including, 0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. As the file also lacks a nonce check, this makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The file is also accessible directly but this is not exploitable in most configurations.

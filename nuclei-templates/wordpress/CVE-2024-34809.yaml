  name: >
    EmpowerWP <= 1.0.21 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Notice Dismissal
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The EmpowerWP theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.21. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the empower_admin_ajax_welcome_notice_dismiss function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss a notice via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

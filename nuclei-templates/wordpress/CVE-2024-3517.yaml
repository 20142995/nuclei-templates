    Shortcodes and extra features for Phlox theme <= 2.15.5 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Accordion Widget
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Shortcodes and extra features for Phlox theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Accordion Widget in all versions up to, and including, 2.15.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and higher, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

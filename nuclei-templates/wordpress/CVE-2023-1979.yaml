info:
  name: >
    Web Stories for WordPress <= 1.31.0 - Insufficient Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Web Stories for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.31.0. This is due to insufficient authorization checks on the duplicate functionality. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level permissions, to duplicate password protected posts and view the content of those protected posts.

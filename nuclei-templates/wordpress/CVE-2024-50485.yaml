info:
  name: >
    Exam Matrix <= 1.5 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Exam Matrix plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.5. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting functionality that makes it possible for unauthenticated users to register as a higher privileged role. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain higher access privileges such as administrative.

  name: "Stock Sync for WooCommerce <= 2.3.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Stock Sync for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.3.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the function push_all, push, update, create_log_table. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to push stock quantities to external sites and create log tables via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

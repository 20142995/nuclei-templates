  name: >
    WP Bing Map Pro <= 4.1.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via AJAX actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Bing Map Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to 4.1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on its AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can lead to plugin settings updates, and execution of several map-related actions such as creation alteration and deletion as well as alteration of user privileges within the plugin.

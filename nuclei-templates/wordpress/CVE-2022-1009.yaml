  name: >
    Smush – Lazy Load Images, Optimize & Compress Images <= 3.9.8 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Smush – Lazy Load Images, Optimize & Compress Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'name' and 'description' parameters in versions up to, and including, 3.9.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This requires an attacker to trick an administrator into uploading a malicious configuration file in order to be successful.

  name: >
    iBryl Switch User <= 1.0.1 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation via Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The iBryl Switch User plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying if a user has the appropriate permissions to switch as another user. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to access other users accounts and elevate their privileges when that account has administrative, or other, level access.

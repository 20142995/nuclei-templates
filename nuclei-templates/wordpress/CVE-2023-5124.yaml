  name: >
    Pagelayer <= 1.7.9 - Authenticated(Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Header/Footer code
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Page Builder: Pagelayer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via header/footer code in all versions up to and including 1.7.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

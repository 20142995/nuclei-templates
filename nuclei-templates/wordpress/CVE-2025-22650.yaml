  description: >
    The Smartarget – Get 40% more sales, improve user engagement with 25+ free apps. plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 1.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

info:
  name: >
    Stream <= 4.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Options Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Stream plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the network_options_action() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options that can lead to DoS or privilege escalation via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    ImagePress – Image Gallery <= 1.2.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Plugin Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The ImagePress – Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'imagepress_admin_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings, including redirection URLs, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: "Block WP Login <= 1.3.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Block WP Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'bwpl_configure_slug()' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

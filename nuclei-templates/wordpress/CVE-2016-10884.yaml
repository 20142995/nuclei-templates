  name: >
    Simple Membership <= 3.3.2 - Multiple Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to multiple Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks in versions up to, and including, 3.3.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain administrative access and perform otherwise restricted actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

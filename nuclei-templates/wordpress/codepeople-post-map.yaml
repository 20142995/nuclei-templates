  name: "Google Maps CP <= 1.0.43 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via feedback_action"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Google Maps CP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.43. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the feedback_action function called via the cp-google-maps-feedback action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized feedback form submission via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

info:
  name: >
    HashThemes Demo Importer <= 1.1.1 - Missing Authorization to Database Wipe
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Hashthemes Demo Importer Plugin for WordPress contained several AJAX functions which relied on a nonce which was visible to all logged-in users for access control in versions up to, and including 1.1.1. This made it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber,  to execute a function that dropped nearly all a sites database tables and removed the contents of wp-content/uploads.

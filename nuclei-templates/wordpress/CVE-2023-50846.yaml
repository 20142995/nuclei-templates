info:
  name: >
    RegistrationMagic Plugin <= 5.2.4.5 - Authenticated(Administrator+) SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The RegistrationMagic â€“ Custom Registration Forms, User Registration, Payment, and User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via an unknown parameter in all versions up to and including 5.2.4.5 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

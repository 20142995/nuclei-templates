  name: >
    my flatonica <= 0.0.8 & my wooden under construction <= 2.0.7 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The my flatonica and my wooden under construction themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 0.0.8 and 2.0.7 respectively due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

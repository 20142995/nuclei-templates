info:
  name: >
    Top Store <= 1.5.4 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Plugin Installation/Activation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Top Store theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary plugin installation due to a missing capability check on the top_store_install_and_activate_callback() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins which can contain other exploitable vulnerabilities to elevate privileges and gain remote code execution.

id: CVE-2023-41736

info:
  name: >
    Email posts to subscribers <= 6.2 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Email posts to subscribers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 6.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only impacts multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

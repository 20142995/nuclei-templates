  name: >
    EleForms – All In One Form Integration including DB for Elementor <= 2.9.9.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The EleForms – All In One Form Integration including DB for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.9.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation when deleting form submissions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete form submissions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

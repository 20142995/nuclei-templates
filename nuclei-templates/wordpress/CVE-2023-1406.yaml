  name: >
    Crocoblock JetEngine <= 3.1.3 - Authenticated(Author+) Arbitrary File Upload to Remote Code Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Crocoblock JetEngine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in versions up to, and including, 3.1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with author-level permissions and above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

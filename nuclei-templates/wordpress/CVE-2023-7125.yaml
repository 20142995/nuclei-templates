  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Community by PeepSo â€“ Social Network, Membership, Registration, User Profiles plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.3.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create user posts on other members walls via a forged request granted they can trick a sites' user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. CVE-2024-31251 appears to be a potential duplicate of this issue.

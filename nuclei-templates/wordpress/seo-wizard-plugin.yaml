    SEO <= 4.0.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The SEO Wizard for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.0.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to write data to the .htaccess and robots.txt files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

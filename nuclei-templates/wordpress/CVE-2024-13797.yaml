  name: >
    PressMart - Modern Elementor WooCommerce WordPress Theme <= 1.2.16 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcode Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The PressMart - Modern Elementor WooCommerce WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.16. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.

info:
  name: >
    Advance Search <= 1.1.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Shortcode Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Advanced Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the WPAS_Advanced_Search_extra_ajax AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete shortcodes via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

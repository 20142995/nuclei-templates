info:
  name: >
    Storely <= 16.6 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Storely theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a malicious display name in all versions up to, and including, 16.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

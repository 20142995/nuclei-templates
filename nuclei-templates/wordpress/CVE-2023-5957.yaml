  name: >
    Ni Purchase Order(PO) For WooCommerce <= 1.2.1 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Ni Purchase Order(PO) For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the image upload functionality in all versions up to, and including 1.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

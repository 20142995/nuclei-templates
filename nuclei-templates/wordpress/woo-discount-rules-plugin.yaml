    Discount Rules for WooCommerce <= 2.0.2 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Discount Rules for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to missing authorization via several AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2 due to missing capability checks on various functions. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to execute various actions and perform a wide variety of actions such as modifying rules and saving configurations.

  name: >
    WP Dashboard Notes <= 1.0.11 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Dashboard Notes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.0.11 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

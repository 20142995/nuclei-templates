  name: >
    IP Blocker Lite <= 11.1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The IP Blocker Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 11.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_configuration, delete_ip, and add_ip_to_db functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable or disable the "Display blank page to the Banned User" setting, delete blocked IPs from the IP blocklist, or add arbitrary IPs to the IP blocklist via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

info:
  name: >
    Photo Gallery by Ays <= 5.2.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Photo Gallery by Ays plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.2.6. This is due to missing nonce validation in the /admin/partials/gallery-photo-gallery-admin-display.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to duplicate galleries via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

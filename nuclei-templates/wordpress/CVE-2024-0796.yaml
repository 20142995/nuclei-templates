  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Active Products Tables for WooCommerce. Professional products tables for WooCommerce store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.6.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions corresponding to AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

    Specialist (Unspecified Version) - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Specialist theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the upload-file.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files which may execute malicious code via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

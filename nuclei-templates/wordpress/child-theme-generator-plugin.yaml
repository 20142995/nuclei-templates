    Child Theme Generator <= 2.2.7 Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Folder Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Child Theme Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerability to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.7 due to insufficient nonce validation on the section_remove function. This makes it possible for attackers to delete arbitrary folders on the affected site, if they can successfully trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

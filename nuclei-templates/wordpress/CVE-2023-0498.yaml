  name: >
    WP Education <= 1.2.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Plugin Activation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Education plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'plugin_activation' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins already installed (but deactivated) on the site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

info:
  name: >
    Decorator - WooCommerce Email Customizer <= 1.2.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Decorator â€“ WooCommerce Email Customizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.7. This is due to missing nonce validation on several functions such as ajax_reset(), wt_decorator_button_text(), wt_decorator_set_as_default(), and more. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify several settings from the plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

info:
  name: >
    Scripts Organizer < 3.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Scripts Organizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in versions up to, but not including, 3.0. This is due to missing capability checks in one of its AJAX actions that is accessible to unauthenticated users. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.

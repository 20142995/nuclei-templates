  name: >
    MP3 Sticky Player <= 8.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read/Download
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The MP3 Sticky Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 8.0 via the content/downloader.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information. Please note the vendor released the patched version as the same version as the affected version.

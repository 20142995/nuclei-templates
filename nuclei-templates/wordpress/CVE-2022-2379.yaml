  name: >
    Easy Student Results <= 2.2.8 -  Missing Authorization to Sensitive Information Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Easy Student Results plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several REST-API endpoints in versions up to, and including, 2.2.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive information about courses and students from the database.

    BuddyForms Members <= 1.4.21 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The plugin BuddyForms Members is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting via various parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.4.21 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

  name: >
    YITH WooCommerce Waiting List <= 2.6.0 - Cross-Site Request forgery via 'save_mail_status'
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The YITH WooCommerce Waiting List plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save_mail_status' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable or disable email notifications via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

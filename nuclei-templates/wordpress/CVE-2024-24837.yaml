  name: >
    FG Drupal to WordPress <= 3.67.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via ajax_importer
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The FG Drupal to WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.67.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_importer() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete logs via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

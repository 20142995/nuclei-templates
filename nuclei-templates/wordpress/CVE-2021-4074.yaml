id: CVE-2021-4074

info:
  name: >
    WHMCS Bridge <= 6.1 Subscriber+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WHMCS Bridge WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the cc_whmcs_bridge_url parameter found in the ~/whmcs-bridge/bridge_cp.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 6.1. Due to missing authorization checks on the cc_whmcs_bridge_add_admin function, low-level authenticated users such as subscribers can exploit this vulnerability.

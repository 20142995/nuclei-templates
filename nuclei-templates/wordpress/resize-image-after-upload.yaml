  name: "Resize Image After Upload <= 1.8.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Resize Image After Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.5 due to insufficient nonce validation in the jr_uploadresize_options() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

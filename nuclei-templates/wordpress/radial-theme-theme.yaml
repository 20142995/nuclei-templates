  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    Various Orange themes for WordPress are vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability in the '/functions/upload-handler.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

  name: >
    WP Inventory Manager <= 2.1.0.13 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via delete_item
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Inventory Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1.0.13. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the delete_item function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is a possible duplicate of CVE-2023-2842.

    School Management System for Wordpress <= 56.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 56.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious code via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

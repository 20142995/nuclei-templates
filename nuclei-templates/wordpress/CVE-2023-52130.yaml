  name: >
    Affiliates Manager <= 2.9.31 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via multiple AJAX actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Affiliates Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.31. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on multiple AJAX functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to approve, decline, and block affiliate applications and manage affiliate status via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

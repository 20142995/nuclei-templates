    Radio Station by netmix® – Manage and play your Show Schedule in WordPress! <= 2.5.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Notice Dismissal
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Radio Station by netmix® – Manage and play your Show Schedule in WordPress! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the radio_station_notice_dismiss() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

info:
  name: >
    Bit File Manager <= 5.2.7 - Authenticated (Admin+) PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Bit File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 5.2.7 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'language' setting parameter. This allows authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.

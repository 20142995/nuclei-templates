  name: >
    Email Encoder <= 2.1.8 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Email Encoder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'eeb_mailto' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 2.1.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. A partial patch was issued in version 2.1.8. The vulnerability was fully patched in 2.1.9.

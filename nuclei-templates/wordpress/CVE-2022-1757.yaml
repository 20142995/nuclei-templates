info:
  name: >
    pagebar <= 2.65 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update and Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The pagebar WordPress plugin through 2.65 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation in some of them, it could also lead to Stored XSS issues

id: CVE-2024-3888

info:
  name: >
    tagDiv Composer <= 4.8 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via button Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's button shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: The vulnerable code in this plugin is specifically tied to the tagDiv Newspaper theme. If another theme is installed (e.g., NewsMag), this code may not be present.

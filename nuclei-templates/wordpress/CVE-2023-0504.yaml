  name: >
    HT Politic <= 2.3.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to Arbitrary Plugin Activation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The HT Politic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.3.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'plugin_activation' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins already installed (but deactivated) on the site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

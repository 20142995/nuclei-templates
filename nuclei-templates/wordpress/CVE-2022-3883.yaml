info:
  name: >
    StopBadBots <= 7.23 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Plugin Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The StopBadBots plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the stopbadbots_install_plugin() function in versions up to, and including, 7.23. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permission, such as a subscriber, to install arbitrary plugins on the vulnerable site. This could be used to install additional vulnerable plugins that could aid in further compromise of the site.

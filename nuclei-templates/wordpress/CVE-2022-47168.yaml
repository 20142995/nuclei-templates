  name: >
    Printful Integration for WooCommerce <= 2.2.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Printful Integration for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call the unprotected function via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

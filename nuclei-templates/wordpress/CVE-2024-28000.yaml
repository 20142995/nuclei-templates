  name: >
    LiteSpeed Cache <= 6.3.0.1 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The LiteSpeed Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 6.3.0.1. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting the role simulation functionality allowing a user to set their current ID to that of an administrator, if they have access to a valid hash which can be found in the debug logs or brute forced. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to spoof their user ID to that of an administrator, and then create a new user account with the administrator role utilizing the /wp-json/wp/v2/users REST API endpoint. In some environments, the crawler may be disabled making this a non-exploitable issue in those instances.

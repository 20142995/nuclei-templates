  name: >
    Really Simple Google Tag Manager <= 1.0.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via plugin_activation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Really Simple Google Tag Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. This is due to missing nonce validation on the plugin_activation() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

info:
  name: >
    Swift Framework <= 2.7.31 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Content Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Swift Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the sf_edit_directory_item() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.31. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary posts with arbitrary content. Unfortunately, we did not receive a response from the vendor to send over the vulnerability details.

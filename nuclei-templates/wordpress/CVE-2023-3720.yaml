  name: >
    Upload Media By URL <= 1.0.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via 'umbu_download'
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Upload Media By URL plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'umbu_download' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files of any type administrators are allowed to upload via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

    Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC) <= 2.8.7 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Media Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized media upload due to a missing capability check on the buddyforms_upload_handle_dropped_media function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload media files.

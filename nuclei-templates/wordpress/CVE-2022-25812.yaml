info:
  name: >
    Transposh WordPress Translation <= 1.0.8.1 - Remote Code Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to remote code execution in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This is due to insufficient extension validation on the log file that can be created via the plugin. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative level permissions and above to set the log file extension to .php and then update a setting to log PHP executable code to that file which can be used to achieve remote code execution.

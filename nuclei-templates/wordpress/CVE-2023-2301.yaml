    Contact Form Builder by vcita <= 4.9.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Contact Form Builder by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.9.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the ls_parse_vcita_callback function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. While the Cross-Site Scripting issue was patched in version 4.10.1, the plugin is still technically vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery since a capability check but no nonce check was added in 4.10.2.

    Generate PDF using Contact Form 7 <= 4.1.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Generate PDF using Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 4.1.2. This is due to missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the 'wp_cf7_pdf_dashboard_html_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. CVE-2024-37555 is a duplicate of this issue.

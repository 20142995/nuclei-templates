    Accordion (All Versions) - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Accordion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ~/js/swfupload/js/upload.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

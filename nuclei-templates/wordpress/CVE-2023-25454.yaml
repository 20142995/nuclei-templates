info:
  name: >
    Protected Posts Logout Button <= 1.4.5 - Missing Authorization on pplb_options_save
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Protected Posts Logout Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized deletion of data due to a missing capability check on the pplb_options_save function in versions up to, and including, 1.4.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings. A nonce check was added in version 1.4.5, which does not address this issue properly. 1.4.6 adds a capability check.

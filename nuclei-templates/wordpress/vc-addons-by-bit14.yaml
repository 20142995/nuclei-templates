  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Web and WooCommerce Addons for WPBakery Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including 1.4.4.1 due to missing capability checks on various functions called via AJAX actions. This makes it possible for any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, to execute the AJAX actions and modify the plugins settings along with injecting malicious web scripts."

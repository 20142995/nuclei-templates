  name: >
    Newspack Blocks <= 3.0.8 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary Directory Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Newspack Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the remove_iframe_archive() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary directories on the server.

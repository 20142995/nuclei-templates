    Post Grid, Post Carousel, & List Category Posts <= 2.4.27 - Authenticated (Editor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Smart Post Show â€“ Post Grid, Post Carousel, Post Slider, Post Timeline, Post Table, and List Category Posts, Latest Posts, Recent Posts, Popular Posts and More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.27 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

  name: >
    Appointment Hour Booking <= 1.3.71 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Appointment Hour Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the cpapphb_feedback function in versions up to, and including, 1.3.71. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to provide plugin feedback.

    ProfileGrid – User Profiles, Groups and Communities <= 5.9.4.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Limited Server-Side Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The ProfileGrid – User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.4.2 via the pm_upload_image function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to download and view images, as well as validating if a non-image file exists, both on local or remote hosts.

  name: >
    NPS computy <= 2.7.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Results Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The NPS computy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the nps_plugin_options function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete results via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

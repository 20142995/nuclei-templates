info:
  name: >
    WooCommerce Predictive Search <= 5.8.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via multiple AJAX actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Predictive Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing nonce check on multiple ajax sync functions in versions up to, and including, 5.8.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to sync various product search results such as categories and SKUs, granted they can trick another user into performing an action, such as clicking on a link.

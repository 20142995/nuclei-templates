  name: >
    Woo Custom and Sequential Order Number <= 2.6.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Woo Custom and Sequential Order Number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wcson_save_settings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

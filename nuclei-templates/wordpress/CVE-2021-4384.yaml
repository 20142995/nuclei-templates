  name: >
    WordPress Photo Gallery – Image Gallery <= 1.0.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WordPress Photo Gallery – Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the load_images_thumbnail() and edit_gallery() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit galleries via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

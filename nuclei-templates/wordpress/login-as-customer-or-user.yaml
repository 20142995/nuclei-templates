    Login as User or Customer <= 2.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Plugin Installation/Activation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Login as User or Customer Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback' AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install and activate other plugins via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

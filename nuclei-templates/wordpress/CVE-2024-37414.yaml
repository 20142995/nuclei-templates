  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Slider & Popup Builder by Depicter â€“ Add Image Slider, Carousel Slider, Exit Intent Popup, Popup Modal, Coupon Popup, Post Slider Carousel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

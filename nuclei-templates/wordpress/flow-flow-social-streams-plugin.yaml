    Flow-Flow Social Feed Stream <= 3.0.71 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Flow-Flow Social Feed Stream plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.0.71 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser.

    Advanced Local Pickup for WooCommerce <= 1.6.2 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Advanced Local Pickup for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on several functions in the ~/include/customizer/customizer-admin.php  file in versions up to, and including, 1.6.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings and send test emails.

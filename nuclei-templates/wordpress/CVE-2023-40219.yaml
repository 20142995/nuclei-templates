  name: >
    Welcart e-Commerce <= 2.8.21 - Authenticated(Editor+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the admin_mail_page() function in versions up to, and including, 2.8.21. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

info:
  name: >
    MainWP Child Reports <= 2.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Options Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The MainWP Child Reports plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the network_options_action() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options that can be leveraged for privilege escalation via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is only exploitable on multisite instances.

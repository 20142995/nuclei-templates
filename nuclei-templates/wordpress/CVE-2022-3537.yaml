  name: >
    Role Based Pricing for WooCommerce <= 1.6.1 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Role Based Pricing for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation, and insufficient authorization in versions up to, and including, 1.6.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.

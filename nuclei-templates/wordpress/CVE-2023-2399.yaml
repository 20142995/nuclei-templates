info:
  name: >
    QuBotChat <= 1.1.5 - Unauthenticated Self-Based Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The QuBotChat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Self-Based Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute when a user accesses the injected page, however, this may only be successful if the attacker can trick the user into pasting a malicious payload into the chat.

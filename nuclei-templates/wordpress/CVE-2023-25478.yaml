id: CVE-2023-25478

info:
  name: >
    Weather Station <= 3.8.11 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Weather Station plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.8.11. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions in the ~/admin/SystemPluginAdmin.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke these functions and switch the plugin modes via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

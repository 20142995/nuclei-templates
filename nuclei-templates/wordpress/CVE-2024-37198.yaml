  name: >
    Digital Newspaper <= 1.1.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Notice Dismissal
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Digital Newspaper theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

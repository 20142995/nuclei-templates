    KB Support <= 1.5.88 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) User Data Retrieval
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The KB Support plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to user data retrieval in versions up to, and including, 1.5.88. This is due to to a missing capability check on the kbs_ajax_get_customer_data() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to execute the function and retrieve limited user data like email, name, phone, and url.

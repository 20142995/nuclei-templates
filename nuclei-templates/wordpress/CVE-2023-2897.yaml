  name: >
    Brizy Page Builder <= 2.4.18 - IP Address Spoofing to Protection Mechanism Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Brizy Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in versions up to, and including, 2.4.18. This is due to an implicit trust of user-supplied IP addresses in an 'X-Forwarded-For' HTTP header for the purpose of validating allowed IP addresses against a Maintenance Mode whitelist. Supplying a whitelisted IP address within the 'X-Forwarded-For' header allows maintenance mode to be bypassed and may result in the disclosure of potentially sensitive information or allow access to restricted functionality.

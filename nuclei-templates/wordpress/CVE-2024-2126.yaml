    Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle <= 2.10.32 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripiting via Registration Form Widget
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Registration Form widget in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.32 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

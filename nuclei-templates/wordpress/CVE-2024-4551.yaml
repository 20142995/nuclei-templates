    Video Gallery – YouTube Playlist, Channel Gallery by YotuWP <= 1.3.13 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary File Inclusion via Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Video Gallery – YouTube Playlist, Channel Gallery by YotuWP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.13 via the display function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and higher, to include and execute arbitrary php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.

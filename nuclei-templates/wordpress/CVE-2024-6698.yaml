info:
  name: >
    FundEngine â€“ Donation and Crowdfunding Platform <= 1.7.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The FundEngine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.0. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying user meta updated through the update_user_meta function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update their user meta which can be leveraged to update their capabilities to gain administrator access.

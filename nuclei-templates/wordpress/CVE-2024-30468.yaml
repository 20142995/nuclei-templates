info:
  name: >
    All In One WP Security <= 5.2.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to IP Blocking
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The All-In-One Security (AIOS) â€“ Security and Firewall plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the render_404_detection() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to block IP addresses that triggered a 404 via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

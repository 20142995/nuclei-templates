  name: >
    Business Card <= 1.0.0 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary File Uplaod
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Business Card plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the admin_view.php file in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

    Reviews Feed – Add Testimonials and Customer Reviews From Google Reviews, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and More <= 1.1.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Reviews Feed – Add Testimonials and Customer Reviews From Google Reviews, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'update_api_key' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update an API key via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

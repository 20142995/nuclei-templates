  name: >
    Contact Form Integrated With Google Maps 1.0 - 2.4 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Contact Form Integrated With Google Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions 1.0 - 2.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

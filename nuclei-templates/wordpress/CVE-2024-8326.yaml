    The s2Member – Excellent for All Kinds of Memberships, Content Restriction Paywalls & Member Access Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 241114 via the 'sc_get_details' function.

The vulnerability was partially patched in version 241114.

    Password Reset with Code for WordPress REST API <= 0.0.15 - Weak Password Recovery Mechanism
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Password Reset with Code for WordPress REST API is vulnerable to a Weak Password Recovery Mechanism in versions up to, and including, 0.0.15. This allows unauthenticated attackers to set a 4-digit password recovery code for arbitrary users that, if guessed correctly, will allow them to reset the password for that user. Although each code is only allowed 3 tries by default, there is no restriction on the number of code generation attempts allowed, effectively reducing the entropy of the password reset mechanism to 4 digits. Additionally the code generation mechanism uses str_shuffle which does not use a cryptographically secure PNRG.

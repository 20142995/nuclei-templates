    Return Refund and Exchange For WooCommerce <= 4.4.5 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Insecure Direct Object Reference
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Return Refund and Exchange For WooCommerce â€“ Return Management System, RMA Exchange, Wallet And Cancel Order Features plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.5 via several functions due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to overwrite linked refund image attachments, overwrite refund request message, overwrite order messages, and read order messages of other users.

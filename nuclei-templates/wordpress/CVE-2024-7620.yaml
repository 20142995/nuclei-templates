info:
  name: >
    Customizer Export/Import <= 0.9.7 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary File Upload via Customization Settings Import
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Customizer Export/Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the '_import' function in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable when used in conjunction with a race condition as the uploaded file is deleted shortly after it is created.

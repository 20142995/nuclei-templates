  name: >
    WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing and Discount Rules <= 2.4.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing and Discount Rules plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to control the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

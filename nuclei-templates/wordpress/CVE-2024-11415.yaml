  name: >
    WP-Orphanage Extended <= 1.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Orphan Account Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP-Orphanage Extended plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wporphanageex_menu_settings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to escalate the privileges of all orphan accounts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    Custom Author Base <= 1.1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Custom Author Base plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

    Waitlist Woocommerce ( Back in stock notifier ) <= 2.5.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Reset
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Waitlist Woocommerce ( Back in stock notifier ) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.3. This is due to missing nonce validation on the reset_settings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

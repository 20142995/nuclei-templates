    Ninja Forms – The Contact Form Builder That Grows With You <= 3.8.19 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Form Calculations
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Ninja Forms – The Contact Form Builder That Grows With You plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the calculations parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.19 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

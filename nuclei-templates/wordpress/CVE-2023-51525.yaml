  name: >
    WP Simple Booking Calendar <= 2.0.8.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Simple Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.8.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpsbc_refresh_calendar_editor function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to refresh the calendar editor via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

    Woffice CRM <= 4.0.1 - Authorization Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Woffice CRM theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the wofficeNotificationGet function in versions up to, and including, 4.0.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view titles of notifications sent from user to user.

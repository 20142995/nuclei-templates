  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Uploading SVG, WEBP and ICO files plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in an unknown function in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This makes it possible for attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.

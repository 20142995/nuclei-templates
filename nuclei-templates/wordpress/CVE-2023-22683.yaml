  name: >
    Clio Grow <= 1.0.0 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Clio Grow plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting up to, and including, 1.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

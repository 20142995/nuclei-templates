  name: >
    WP Booking Calendar <= 10.10 - Unauthenticated Post-Confirmation Booking Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Post-Confirmation Booking Manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 10.10. This is due to the plugin not properly requiring re-verification after a booking has been made and a change is being attempted. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate their confirmed bookings, even after they have been approved.

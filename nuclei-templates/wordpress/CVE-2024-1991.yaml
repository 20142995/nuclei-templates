    RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms, User Registration, Payment, and User Login <= 5.3.0.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms, User Registration, Payment, and User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the update_users_role() function in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.0.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to escalate their privileges to that of an administrator

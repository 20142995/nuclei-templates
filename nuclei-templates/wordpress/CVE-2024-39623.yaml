  name: >
    ListingPro <= 2.9.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The ListingPro theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to takeover user accounts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

id: CVE-2024-6125

info:
  name: >
    Login with phone number <= 1.7.34 - Insecure Password Reset Mechanism
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized password resets in versions up to, and including 1.7.34. This is due to the plugin generating too weak a reset code, and the code used to reset the password has no attempt or time limit. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the password of arbitrary users by guessing a 6-digit numeric reset code.

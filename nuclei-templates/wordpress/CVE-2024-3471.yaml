    Button Generator – easily Button Builder <= 2.3.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Button Generator – easily Button Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the button-generation function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete buttons via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

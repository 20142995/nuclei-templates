info:
  name: >
    Swiss Toolkit For WP <= 1.0.7 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Authentication Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Swiss Toolkit For WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This is due to the plugin storing custom data in post metadata without an underscore prefix. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator.

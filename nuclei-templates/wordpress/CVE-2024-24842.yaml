    Knowledge Base for Documentation, FAQs with AI Assistance <= 11.30.2 - Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection in is_article_recently_viewed
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Knowledge Base for Documentation, FAQs with AI Assistance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 11.30.2 via deserialization of untrusted input in the is_article_recently_viewed function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.

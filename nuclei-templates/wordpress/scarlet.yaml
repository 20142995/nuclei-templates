  description: "The Scarlet theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in all versions due to the inclusion of a vulnerable version of ZeroClipboard. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

  name: >
    Easy Forms for Mailchimp <= 6.8.8 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Cross-Site Scripting via Form Name
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The  Easy Forms for Mailchimp plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Form Name in versions up to, and including, 6.8.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

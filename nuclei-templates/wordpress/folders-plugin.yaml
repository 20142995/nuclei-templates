    Folders <= 2.9.2 - Authenticated (Author+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the handle_folders_file_upload function in versions up to, and including, 2.9.2. This makes it possible for authors or higher to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Gallery Blocks with Lightbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized data modification due to a missing capability check on the pgc_sgb_action_wizard function called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 3.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to retrieve and edit post data and metadata, update and retrieve arbitrary options, retrieve post listings, as well as taxonomy terms and post content.

  name: >
    ChatBot <= 4.4.4 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin settings in versions up to, and including, 4.4.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping and a lack of nonce check on the 'openai_settings_option_callback' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers  to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, granted they can trick an authenticated user into performing an action, such as clicking a link.

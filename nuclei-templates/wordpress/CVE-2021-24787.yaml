info:
  name: >
    Client Invoicing by Sprout Invoices <= 19.9.6 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Client Invoicing by Sprout Invoices plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 5.5 due to the plugin not sanitising and escaping some of its settings. This makes it possible for high privilege users to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages to perform attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.

  name: >
    Duplicator <= 1.5.9 - Full Path Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Duplicator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain the full path to instances, which they may be able to use in combination with other vulnerabilities or to simplify reconnaissance work. On its own, this information is of very limited use.

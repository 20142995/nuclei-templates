  name: >
    WP Responsive Tabs horizontal vertical and accordion Tabs <= 1.1.15 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Responsive Tabs horizontal vertical and accordion Tabs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.1.15 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the $setacrionpage value. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

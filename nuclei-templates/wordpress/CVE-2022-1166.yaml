info:
  name: >
    Noo JobMonster <= 4.6.6 - Sensitive Information Disclosure via Directory Listing
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Noo JobMonster theme is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Disclosure via Directory Listing in the /wp-content/uploads/jobmonster/ folder, as it did not include a default PHP file, or .htaccess file in versions up to, and including 4.6.6. This could expose personal data such as people's resumes. Although Directory Listing can be prevented by securely configuring the web server, vendors can also take measures to make it less likely to happen.

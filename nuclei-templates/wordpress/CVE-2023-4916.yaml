  name: >
    Login with phone number <= 1.5.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to User Password Change
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.6. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'lwp_update_password_action' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user password via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

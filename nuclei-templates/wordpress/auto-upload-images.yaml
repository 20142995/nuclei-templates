  name: "Auto Upload Images <= 3.3 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WordPress Auto Upload Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 3.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."

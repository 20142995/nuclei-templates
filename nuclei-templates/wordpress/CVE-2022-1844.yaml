info:
  name: >
    WP Sentry <= 1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Sentry WordPress plugin through 1.0 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack and lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping as well

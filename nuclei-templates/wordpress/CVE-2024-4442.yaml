info:
  name: >
    Salon booking system <= 9.9 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Salon booking system plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion in all versions up to, and including, 9.8. This is due to the plugin not properly validating the path of an uploaded file prior to deleting it. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible. This was partially patched in 9.9, and sufficiently patched in 10.0.

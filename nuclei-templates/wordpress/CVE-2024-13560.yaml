  name: >
    Subscriptions & Memberships for PayPal <= 1.1.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Post Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Subscriptions & Memberships for PayPal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

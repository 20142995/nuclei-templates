    Thumbnail For Excerpts <= 2.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Thumbnail For Excerpts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1 . This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the tfe_add_admin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This vulnerability can also be used to update options.

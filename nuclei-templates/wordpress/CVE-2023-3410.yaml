info:
  name: >
    Bricks <= 1.10.1 - Authenticated (Bricks Page Builder Access+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the â€˜customTag' attribute in versions up to, and including, 1.10.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the Bricks Builder (admin-only by default), to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This becomes more of an issue when Bricks Builder access is granted to lower-privileged users.

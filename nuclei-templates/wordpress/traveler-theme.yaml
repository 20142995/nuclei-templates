    Travel Booking WordPress Theme < 2.7.8.4 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Travel Booking WordPress Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to both Reflected and Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 2.7.8.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link, and for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser.

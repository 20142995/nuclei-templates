  name: "Sahifa <= 2.4.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Sahifa theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the 'mpanel-functions.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

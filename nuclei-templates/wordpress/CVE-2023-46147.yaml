info:
  name: >
    Themify Ultra <= 7.3.5 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The themify-ultra theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 7.3.5 via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber access and above to inject a PHP Object. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.

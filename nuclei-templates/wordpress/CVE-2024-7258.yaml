info:
  name: >
    WooCommerce Google Feed Manager <= 2.8.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Google Feed Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wppfm_removeFeedFile' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).

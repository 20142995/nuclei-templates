  name: >
    RegistrationMagic <= 5.2.5.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The RegistrationMagic â€“ Custom Registration Forms, User Registration, Payment, and User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.5.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the rm_options_default_payment_method() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the default payment method via a forged request granted they can trick an authenticated site user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

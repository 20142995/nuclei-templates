  name: >
    WooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway <= 7.4.0 - Unauthenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference to Sensitive Information Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in versions up to, and including, 7.4.0. This is due to insufficient validation in the payment_fields() and javascript_params () functions that do not properly validate order ownership. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve potentially sensitive data for orders other than their own.

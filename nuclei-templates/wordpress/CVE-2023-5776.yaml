info:
  name: >
    Post Meta Data Manager <= 1.2.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Post, Term, and User Meta Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Post Meta Data Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the pmdm_wp_ajax_delete_meta, pmdm_wp_delete_user_meta, and pmdm_wp_delete_user_meta functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary user, term, and post meta via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

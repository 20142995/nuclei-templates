  name: >
    Headline Analyzer <= 1.3.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Headline Analyzer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several REST API endpoints. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform several actions granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

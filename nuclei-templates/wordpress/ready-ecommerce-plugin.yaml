    Ready! Ecommerce Shopping Cart < 0.5.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Ready! Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting in versions before 0.5.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make unauthorized AJAX calls to perform arbitrary actions via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    Directorist <= 7.5.4 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Insecure Direct Object Reference to Arbitrary Post Deletion in listing_task
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Directorist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an Insecure Direct Object Reference in versions up to, and including, 7.5.4. This is due to improper validation and authorization checks within the listing_task function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete arbitrary posts. Please note CVE-2023-35052 appears to be a duplicate of this issue.

  name: >
    BeePress <= 6.9.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via beepress-pro.php
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The BeePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.9.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on multiple functions in the beepress-pro.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    Republish Old Posts <= 1.21 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via rop_options_page
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Republish Old Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.21. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the rop_options_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

info:
  name: >
    Total Upkeep <= 1.14.13 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Information Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Total Upkeep plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in versions up to, and including 1.14.13. This is due to missing authorization on the heartbeat_received() function that triggers on WordPress heartbeat. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above to retrieve back-up paths that can subsequently be used to download the back-up.

  name: "VS Contact Form <= 11.5 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The VS Contact Form plugin for WordPress may be vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] parameter in versions up to, and including, 11.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a victim into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Only victims using older browser should be impacted as newer browsers urlencode the REQUEST_URI parameter by default"

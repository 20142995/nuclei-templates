  name: >
    Google Analytics by Monster Insights <= 8.14.0 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Google Analytics by Monster Insights plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 8.14.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the style attribute. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

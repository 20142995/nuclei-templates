    Account Manager for WooCommerce <= 2.1.1 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Account Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check in versions up to, and including, 2.1.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to export sensitive information such as user id, first name, and last name of registered users.

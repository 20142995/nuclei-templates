    Soundslides < 2.5.0 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Soundslides plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.1.0 due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of jPlayer. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

    AI ChatBot 4.9.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery on AJAX actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The AI ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in version 4.9.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the corresponding functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This vulnerability is the same as CVE-2023-5534, but was reintroduced in version 4.9.2.

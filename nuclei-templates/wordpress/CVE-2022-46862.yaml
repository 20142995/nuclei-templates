  name: >
    Quiz And Survey Master <= 8.0.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.0.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the qsm_update_text_message function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function leading to quiz modifications, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

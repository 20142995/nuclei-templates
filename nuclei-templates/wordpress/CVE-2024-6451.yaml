info:
  name: >
    AI Engine <= 2.5.0 - Authenticated (Admin+) Remote Code Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.0 via the /wp-json/mwai/v1/settings/update REST API endpoint. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a log path file extension allowing a user to set the log extension as .php making the file executable. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to execute code on the server.

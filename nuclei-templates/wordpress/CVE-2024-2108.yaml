    Ninja Forms Contact Form – The Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress <= 3.8.0 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Ninja Forms Contact Form – The Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via an image title embedded into a form in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

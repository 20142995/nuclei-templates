  name: >
    Payment Gateway Based Fees and Discounts for WooCommerce <= 2.12.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Notice Dismissal
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Payment Gateway Based Fees and Discounts for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.12.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the dismiss_notice() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

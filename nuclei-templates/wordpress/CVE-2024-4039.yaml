  name: >
    Orders Tracking for WooCommerce <= 1.2.10 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcode Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The The Orders Tracking for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.10. This is due to the plugin allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. A partial patch was released in 1.2.10, and a complete patch was released in 1.2.11.

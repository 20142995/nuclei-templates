    Post to Google My Business <= 3.1.14 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Dismiss Notification
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Post to Google My Business plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.1.14. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_delete_notification function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notifications via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

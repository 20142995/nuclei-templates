    So Audible Cloud Music Player <= 0.9 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The So Audible Cloud Music Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 0.9 due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of jPlayer. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

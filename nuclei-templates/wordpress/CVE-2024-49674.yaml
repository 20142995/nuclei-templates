  name: >
    EKC Tournament Manager <= 2.2.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The EKC Tournament Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

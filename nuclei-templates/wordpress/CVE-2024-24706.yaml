  name: >
    WP-CFM  <= 1.7.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via multiple AJAX functions
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP-CFM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on multiple AJAX functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

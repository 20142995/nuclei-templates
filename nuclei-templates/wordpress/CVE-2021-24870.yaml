  name: >
    WP Fastest Cache < 0.9.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions before 0.9.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpfc_save_cdn_integration function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform stored cross-site scripting attacks via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

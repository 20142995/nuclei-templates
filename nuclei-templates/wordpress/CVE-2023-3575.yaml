  name: >
    Quiz And Survey Master <= 8.1.10 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Question Title
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a question title in versions up to, and including 8.1.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

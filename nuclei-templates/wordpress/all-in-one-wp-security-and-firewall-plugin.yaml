    All In One WP Security 5.1.9 - Plaintext Storage of Credentials
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The All In One WP Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure in version 5.1.9. This is due to insufficient encryption on credentials stored in database logs. This makes it possible for attackers to retrieve the username and password of users that have logged into the site, granted they obtain access to the database which would require successfully exploiting another vulnerability such as SQL injection or use of weak passwords.

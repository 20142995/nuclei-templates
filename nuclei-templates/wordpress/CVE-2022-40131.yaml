  name: >
    Page View Count <= 2.5.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Page View Count plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the reset_settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's settings, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    Backup and Restore Wordpress <= 1.50 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Backup Trigger
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Backup and Restore WordPress â€“ Backup Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.50. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_queue_manual_backup() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger backups via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

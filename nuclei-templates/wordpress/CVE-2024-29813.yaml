  name: >
    Funnel Builder by CartFlows <= 2.0.1 - Authenticated (Editor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via settings
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Checkout & Funnel Builder by CartFlows â€“ Create High Converting Stores For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This primarily affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

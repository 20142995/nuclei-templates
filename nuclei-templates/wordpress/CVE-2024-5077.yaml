  name: >
    Wp EMember <= 10.6.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Wp EMember plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 10.6.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the manage_blacklist() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts and update the blacklist via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

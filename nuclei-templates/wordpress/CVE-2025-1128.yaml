    Everest Forms <= 3.0.9.4 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload, Read, and Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Everest Forms â€“ Contact Forms, Quiz, Survey, Newsletter & Payment Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload, read, and deletion due to missing file type and path validation in the 'format' method of the EVF_Form_Fields_Upload class in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.9.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload, read, and delete arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution, sensitive information disclosure, or a site takeover possible.

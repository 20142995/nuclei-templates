    Editorial Assistant by Sovrn <= 1.3.3 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Attachment Upload and Set Post Featured Image
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Editorial Assistant by Sovrn plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ajax_zemanta_set_featured_image' function in versions up to, and including, 1.3.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload attachment files (such as jpg, png, txt, zip), and set the post featured image.

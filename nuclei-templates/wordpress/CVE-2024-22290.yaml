  name: >
    Custom Dashboard Widgets <= 1.3.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via cdw_DashboardWidgets
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Custom Dashboard Widgets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'cdw_DashboardWidgets' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings, including adding a Cross-Site Scripting payload, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

id: CVE-2022-2440

info:
  name: >
    Theme Editor <= 2.8 - Authenticated (Admin+) PHAR Deserialization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Theme Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'images_array' parameter in versions up to, and including 2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative privileges to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.

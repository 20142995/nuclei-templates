    CDI <= 5.5.3 - Authenticated (Shop Manager+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The CDI â€“ Collect and Deliver Interface for Woocommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 5.5.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

info:
  name: >
    Wholesale Market for WooCommerce <= 1.0.6 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Download
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Wholesale Market for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file download due to missing capability checks and user input validation during the system path generation process in versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download arbitrary files on the affected sites server, including database configuration files. While version 1.0.7 adds capability checks, the issue remains exploitable by high-level users.

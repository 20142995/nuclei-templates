    WP Courses LMS <= 3.2.3 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Courses LMS â€“ Online Courses Builder, eLearning Courses, Courses Solution, Education Courses plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to missing capability checks on several functions in the ~/ajax/ajax-lesson-order.php file hooked via AJAX in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform several actions such as adding, deleting and renaming lesson modules.

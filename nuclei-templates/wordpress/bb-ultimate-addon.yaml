  severity: low
  description: "The Ultimate Addons for Beaver Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on the get-google-data() and get-facebook-data() functions in versions up to, and including, 1.24.0. This makes it possible for unauthorized attackers to log into any account on the associated service, including admin."

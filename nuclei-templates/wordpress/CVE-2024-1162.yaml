  name: >
    Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle <= 2.10.29 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.29. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the register_reference() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers  to update the connected API keys via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

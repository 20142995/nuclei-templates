  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The ECOBIZ <= 3.3, Ebiz <= 1.2, Avanix <=  1.2, and Ovum (unknown version) themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser."

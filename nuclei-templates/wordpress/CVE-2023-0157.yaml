  name: >
    All-In-One Security (AIOS) <= 5.1.4 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The  All-In-One Security (AIOS) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via log files in versions up to, and including, 5.1.4  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

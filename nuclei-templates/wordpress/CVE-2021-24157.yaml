info:
  name: >
    Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle <= 2.10.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle has a feature to add custom scripts to the header and footer of a page or post. There were no checks to verify that a user had the unfiltered_html capability prior to saving the script tags, thus allowing lower-level users to inject scripts that could potentially be malicious in versions up to, and including 2.10.2.

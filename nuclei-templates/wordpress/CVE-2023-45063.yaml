    AI Content Writing Assistant (Content Writer, ChatGPT, Image Generator) All in One <= 1.1.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The AI Content Writing Assistant (Content Writer, ChatGPT, Image Generator) All in One plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.6. This is due to incorrect nonce validation in the aiwa_checkNonce() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

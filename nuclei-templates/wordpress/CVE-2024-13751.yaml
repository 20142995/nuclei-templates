  name: >
    3D Photo Gallery <= 1.3 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The 3D Photo Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'des[]' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

    Member Directory and Contact Form <= 1.7.0 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Member Directory and Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the pta_directory_save_order() function in versions up to, and including, 1.7.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change the order of items.

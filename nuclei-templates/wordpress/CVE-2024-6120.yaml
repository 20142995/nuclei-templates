    Sparkle Demo Importer <= 1.4.7 - Missing Authorization to Authorized(Subscriber+) Post/Pages/Attachements Deletion and Demo Data Import
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Sparkle Demo Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized database reset and demo data import due to a missing capability check on the multiple functions in all versions up to and including 1.4.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete all posts, pages, and uploaded files, as well as download and install a limited set of demo plugins.

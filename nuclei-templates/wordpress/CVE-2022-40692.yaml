  name: >
    Sunshine Photo Cart <= 2.9.13 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Sunshine Photo Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.13. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the sunshine_update_image_location_ajax function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change image file paths, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

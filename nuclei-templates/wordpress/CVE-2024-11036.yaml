  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The The GamiPress – The #1 gamification plugin to reward points, achievements, badges & ranks in WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via gamipress_get_user_earnings AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 7.1.5. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.

    Post Grid, Form Maker, Popup Maker, WooCommerce Blocks, Post Blocks, Post Carousel – Combo Blocks <= 2.2.80 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Post Grid, Form Maker, Popup Maker, WooCommerce Blocks, Post Blocks, Post Carousel – Combo Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'tag' attribute in blocks in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.80 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

  name: >
    Light Poll <= 1.0.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Poll Answers Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Light Poll plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete poll answers via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

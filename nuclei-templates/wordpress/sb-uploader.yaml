  name: "SB Uploader <= 4.8 - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The SB Uploader plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the sb_uploader.php file in versions up to, and including, 4.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."

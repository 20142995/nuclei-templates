    SureForms – Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress <= 1.2.2 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Protected Post Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The SureForms – Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2 via the handle_export_form() function due to a missing capability check. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.

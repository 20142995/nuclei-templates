  name: "Track That Stat < 1.1.0 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Track That Stat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in versions before 1.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser."

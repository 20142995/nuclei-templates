  name: >
    OceanWP <= 3.5.4 - Missing Authorization to Sensitive Information Exposure via Limited Local File Inclusion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The OceanWP theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the load_theme_panel_pane function in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to expose sensitive information such as system/environment data and API keys.

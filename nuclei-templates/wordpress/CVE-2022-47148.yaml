info:
  name: >
    WooCommerce PDF Invoices & Packing Slips <= 3.2.5 - Cross Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce PDF Invoices & Packing Slips plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.2.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the attachment_settings_hint() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the hide attachments setting hint via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

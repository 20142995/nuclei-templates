    RegistrationMagic <= 5.2.5.0 - Form Submission Limit Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The RegistrationMagic â€“ Custom Registration Forms, User Registration, Payment, and User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to form submission limit bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.5.0 due to insufficient protection logic. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to submit more form entries than the form submission limit allows.

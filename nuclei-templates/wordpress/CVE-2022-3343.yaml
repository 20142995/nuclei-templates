    WPQA - Builder forms Addon For WordPress (<= 5.9.2),  Himer (<= 1.9.3) and Discy (<= 5.5.3) - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Insecure Direct Object Reference
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WPQA - Builder forms Addon For WordPress plugin is vulnerable to insecure direct object reference in versions up to, and including, 5.9.2 along with the Himer (<= 1.9.3) and Discy (<= 5.5.3) WordPress themes. This is due to insufficient validation of user follows on the wpqa_following_you_ajax action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level capabilities and above to inflate follower counts of others by sending repeat follow requests.

info:
  name: >
    WP Affiliate Disclosure <= 1.2.7 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via $id
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Affiliate Disclosure plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the $id variable in versions up to, and including, 1.2.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

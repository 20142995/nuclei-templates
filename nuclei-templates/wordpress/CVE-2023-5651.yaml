  name: >
    WP Hotel Booking <= 2.0.7 - Missing Authorization to (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Post Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Hotel Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the tp_extra_package_remove() function hooked via AJAX in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary posts.

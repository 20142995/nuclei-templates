    Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload – Contact Form 7 <= 1.3.6.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery in dnd_upload_cf7_upload and dnd_codedropz_upload_delete
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload – Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.6.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the dnd_upload_cf7_upload and dnd_codedropz_upload_delete functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload or delete files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

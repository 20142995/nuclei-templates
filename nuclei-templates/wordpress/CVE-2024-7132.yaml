  name: >
    Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks – CoBlocks <= 3.1.12 - Authenticated (Editor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks – CoBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via post settings in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.12 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

info:
  name: >
    Comments Like Dislike <= 1.2.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Plugin Setting Reset
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Comments Like Dislike plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the restore_settings function called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to reset the plugin's settings. NOTE: this issue is was only partially patched in version 1.2.0, as the nonce is still present to subscriber-level users.

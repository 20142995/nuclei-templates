    TNIT Filter Gallery Plugin <= 0.0.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The TNIT Filter Gallery Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 0.0.6. This is due to improperly implemented nonce protection in several AJAX Calls. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative actions leading to subsequent XSS attacks via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

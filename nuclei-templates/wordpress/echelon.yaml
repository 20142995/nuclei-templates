    Echelon (All Versions) -  Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Echelon theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ~/lib/admin/functions/media-upload.php file in all versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.

    Q and A <= 1.0.6.2 Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Q and A plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.0.6.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on various functions/parameters. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform SQLIs and XSSs (vulnerabilities explained in detail in reference) via forged requests granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

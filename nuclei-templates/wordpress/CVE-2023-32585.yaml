  name: >
    Portfolio Gallery – Responsive Image Gallery <= 1.4.5 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Gallery Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Portfolio Gallery – Responsive Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the TotalSoftPortfolio_Del_Callback() function called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.4.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary galleries. Please note there are many additional AJAX actions that are also vulnerable and can be used to perform other actions like cloning galleries and editing limited details for them.

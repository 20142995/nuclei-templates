info:
  name: >
    User Access Manager <= 2.2.16 - IP Spoofing
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The User Access Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in versions up to, and including, 2.2.16. This is due to insufficient restrictions, and the prioritization of REMOTE_ADDR, on where the IP Address information is being retrieved for access restrictions. Attackers can supply the X-Forwarded-For header with with a different IP Address that will be logged and can be used to bypass settings that may have blocked out an IP address from accessing a restricted area.

    ARMember – Membership Plugin, Content Restriction, Member Levels, User Profile & User signup <= 4.0.51 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Shortcode Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The The ARMember – Membership Plugin, Content Restriction, Member Levels, User Profile & User signup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.51. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes.

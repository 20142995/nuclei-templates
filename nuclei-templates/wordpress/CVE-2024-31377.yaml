  name: >
    WP Photo Album Plus <= 8.7.01.001 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WP Photo Album Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation on the import functionality and no capability check in all versions up to, and including, 8.7.01.001. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

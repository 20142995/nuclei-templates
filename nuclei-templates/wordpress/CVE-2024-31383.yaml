  name: >
    PopularFX <= 1.2.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Notice Dismissal
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The PopularFX theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the popularfx_getting_started_notice() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

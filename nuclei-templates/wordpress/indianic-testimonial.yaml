  name: "Testimonial < 2.3 - Multiple Vulnerabilities"
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "The Testimonial plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_testimonial function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection attacks via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

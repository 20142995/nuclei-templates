  name: >
    LinkWorth plugin <= 3.3.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Plugin Setting Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The LinkWorth plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.3.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update_advanced_options_action action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger plugin setting updates and deletion via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

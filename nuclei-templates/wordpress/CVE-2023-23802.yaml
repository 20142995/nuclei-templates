    HT Easy GA4 ( Google Analytics 4 ) <= 1.0.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via plugin_activation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The HT Easy GA4 ( Google Analytics 4 ) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the plugin_activation function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate plugins via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

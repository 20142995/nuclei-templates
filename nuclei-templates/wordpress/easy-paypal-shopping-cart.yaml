  name: "Easy PayPal Shopping Cart <= 1.1.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Easy PayPal Shopping Cart for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.9. This is due to missing nonce validation on the wpepsc_plugin_options function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugins setting and add malicious web scripts to the settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

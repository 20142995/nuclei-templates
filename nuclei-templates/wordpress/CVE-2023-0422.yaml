info:
  name: >
    Article Directory <= 1.3 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'publish_terms_text'
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Article Directory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'publish_terms_text' admin setting in versions up to, and including, 1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

info:
  name: >
    Dokan <= 3.0.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Dokan plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.0.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the handle_order_export() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger an order export via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

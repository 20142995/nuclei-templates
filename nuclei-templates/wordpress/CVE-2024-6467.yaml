  name: >
    BookingPress Appointment Booking <= 1.1.5 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Read to Arbitrary File Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The BookingPress â€“ Appointment Booking Calendar Plugin and Online Scheduling Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read to Arbitrary File Creation in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.5 via the 'bookingpress_save_lite_wizard_settings_func' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary files that contain the content of files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files or the exposure of sensitive information.

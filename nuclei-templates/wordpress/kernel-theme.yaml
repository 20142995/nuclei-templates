  name: "Kernel - Premium WordPress Blog & Magazine Theme | News / Editorial (All Versions) - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."

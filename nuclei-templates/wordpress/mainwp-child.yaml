    MainWP Child – Securely connects sites to the MainWP WordPress Manager Dashboard < 2.0.9.2 - Authentication Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The MainWP Child – Securely connects sites to the MainWP WordPress Manager Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.0.9.1. This is due to a missing credential check within the WordPress init hook. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including administrator-level accounts, if the attacker knows the username.

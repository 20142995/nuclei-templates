info:
  name: >
    Timetics <= 1.0.23 - Authorization Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Timetics- AI-powered Appointment Booking Calendar and Online Scheduling Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized booking in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.23. This is due to the plugin not properly validating if a user is authorized to make a booking. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to book things they shouldn't be able to.

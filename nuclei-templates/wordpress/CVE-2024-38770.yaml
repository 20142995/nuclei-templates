info:
  name: >
    Backup and Staging by WP Time Capsule <= 1.22.20 - Authentication Bypass to Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Backup and Staging by WP Time Capsule plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.22.20. This is due to wptc_decode_auth_token() function using a loose comparison. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and access user accounts, including those that may have administrative access. This vulnerability does require a site to have a connection to wptimecapsule.com in order to be exploited.

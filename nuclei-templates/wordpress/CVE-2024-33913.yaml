    Xserver Migrator <= 1.6.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Xserver Migrator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

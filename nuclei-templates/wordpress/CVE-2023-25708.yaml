id: CVE-2023-25708

info:
  name: >
    WP VR <= 8.2.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP VR plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.2.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'wpvr_role_management' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings, including granting author-level users the ability to create VR tours, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

    EditionGuard for WooCommerce – eBook Sales with DRM <= 3.4.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The EditionGuard for WooCommerce – eBook Sales with DRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.4.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to escalate their privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

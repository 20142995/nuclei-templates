    AcyMailing <= 9.7.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload via acym_extractArchive Function
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The AcyMailing â€“ An Ultimate Newsletter Plugin and Marketing Automation Solution for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the acym_extractArchive function in all versions up to, and including, 9.7.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

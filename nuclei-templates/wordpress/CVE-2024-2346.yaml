    The FileBird – WordPress Media Library Folders & File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 5.6.3 via folder deletion due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author access or higher, to delete folders created by other users and make their file uploads visible.

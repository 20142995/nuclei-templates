info:
  name: >
    Download Manager <= 3.2.70 - Insufficient Authorization to Information Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in versions up to, and including, 3.2.7.0, due to insufficient validation of passwords on password protected files. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the downloads area to create a password protected post which returns a master key, and then subsequently use that master key and original password to access any other password protected post.

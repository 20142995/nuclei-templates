  name: >
    Store Locator WordPress <= 1.4.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Store Locator WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the handle_request function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

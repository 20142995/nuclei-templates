  description: "The Plausible Analytics plugin is vulnerable to unauthorized setting changes in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3 due to an improperly configured capability and nonce check on the save_admin_settings() function. This could be exploited by any authenticated user, including those with minimal capabilities like subscribers."

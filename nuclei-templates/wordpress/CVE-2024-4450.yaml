    AliExpress Dropshipping with AliNext Lite <= 3.3.6 - Missing Authorization via Several Functions
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The AliExpress Dropshipping with AliNext Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on several functions in the ImportAjaxController.php file in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform several actions like importing and modifying products. CVE-2024-37210 is likely a duplicate of this issue.

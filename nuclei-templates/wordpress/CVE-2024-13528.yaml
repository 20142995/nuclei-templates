id: CVE-2024-13528

info:
  name: >
    Customer Email Verification for WooCommerce <= 2.9.5 - Authentication Bypass via Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Customer Email Verification for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.5. This is due to the presence of a shortcode that will generate a confirmation link with a placeholder email. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to generate a verification link for any unverified user and log into the account. The 'Fine tune placement' option must be enabled in the plugin settings in order to exploit the vulnerability.

info:
  name: >
    Disqus Conditional Load <= 11.1.0 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via plugin settings.
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Disqus Conditional Load plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via plugin options such as 'dcl_div_width', 'dcl_type', and others in versions up to, and including, 11.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level access, and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

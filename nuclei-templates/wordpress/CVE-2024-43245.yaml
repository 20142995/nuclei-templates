  name: >
    JobSearch <= 2.3.4 - Authentication Bypass to Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.4. This is due to the plugin not properly validating identity on login functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain access to accounts they should not have access to.

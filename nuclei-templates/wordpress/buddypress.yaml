  name: "BuddyPress <= 7.2.0 - Authorization Bypass to Private Message Disclosure"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The BuddyPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the BuddyPress Nouveau and the BuddyPress REST API /buddypress/v1/messages endpoint in versions 5.0.0 - 7.2.0. This makes it possible for non-privileged attackers to read private messages in a thread they were not invited to."

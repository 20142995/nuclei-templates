  name: >
    Clock In Portal <= 2.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Holidays Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Clock In Portal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the delete action in the holidays.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete holidays via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

info:
  name: >
    File Manager Pro <= 8.3.9 - Unauthenticated Limited JavaScript File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited JavaScript File Upload in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.9. This is due to a lack of proper checks on allowed file types. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, with permissions granted by an administrator, to upload .css and .js files, which could lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting.

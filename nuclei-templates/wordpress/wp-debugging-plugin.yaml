    WP Debugging <= 2.11.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Debugging plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.11.7. This is due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of the wp-dependency-installer library. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install and activate arbitrary plugins via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    Calendar Event Multi View <= 1.4.06 - Missing Authorization to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Calendar Event Multi View plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on event creation and deletion in versions up to, and including, 1.4.06 . This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate events. Additionally, some of the event fields do not undergo proper sanitization leading to the potential of Stored Cross-Site Scripting.

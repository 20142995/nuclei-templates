  name: "Asset CleanUp: Page Speed Booster <= 1.3.6.6 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Asset CleanUp: Page Speed Booster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the tab parameter in versions up to, and including 1.3.6.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on add_query_arg and remove_query_arg. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in administrative pages that execute if they can successfully trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

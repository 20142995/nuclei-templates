info:
  name: >
    Premium Packages – Sell Digital Products Securely <= 5.9.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Premium Packages – Sell Digital Products Securely plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the wpdmpp_async_request() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform actions such as initiating refunds via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator or shop manager into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

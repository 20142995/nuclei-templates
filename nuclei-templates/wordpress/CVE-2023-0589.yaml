  name: >
    WP Image Carousel WordPress - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Image Carousel WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the wpic shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

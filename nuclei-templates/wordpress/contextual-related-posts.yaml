  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Contextual Related Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the crp_ajax_clearcache function in versions up to, and including, 3.3.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to clear the Contextual Related Posts cache."

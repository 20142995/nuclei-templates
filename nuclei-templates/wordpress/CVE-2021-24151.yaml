info:
  name: >
    WP Editor <= 1.2.6.3 - Authenticated (Admin+) SQL injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to blind SQL Injection via the setting fields in versions up to, and including, 1.2.6.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user-supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated admin+ attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

    MP3 jPlayer <= 2.7.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The MP3 jPlayer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.7.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute them, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

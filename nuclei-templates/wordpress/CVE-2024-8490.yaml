  name: >
    PropertyHive <= 2.0.19 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via save_account_details
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The PropertyHive plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.19. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save_account_details' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit the name, email address, and password of an administrator account via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

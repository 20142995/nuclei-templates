info:
  name: >
    AI Post Generator | AutoWriter <= 3.3 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The AI Post Generator | AutoWriter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access, modification or deletion of posts due to a missing capability check on functions hooked by AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 3.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to view all posts generated with this plugin (even in non-published status), create new posts (and publish them), publish unpublished post or perform post deletions. CVE-2024-32713 may be a duplicate of this issue.

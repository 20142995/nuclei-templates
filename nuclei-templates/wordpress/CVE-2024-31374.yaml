  name: >
    AppPresser <= 4.3.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via force_logging_off()
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The AppPresser plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.3.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the force_logging_off() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to turn logging off via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

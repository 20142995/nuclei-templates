    ShopWP <= 2.0.4 - Missing Authorization to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The ShopWP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several REST API routes in versions up to, and including, 2.0.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call the endpoints and perform unauthorized actions such as updating the plugin's settings and injecting malicious scripts.

    Order Export & Order Import for WooCommerce <= 2.4.3 - Authenticated (Shop Manager+) Arbitrary File Upload via upload_import_file
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Order Export & Order Import for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the upload_import_file function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with shop manager-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

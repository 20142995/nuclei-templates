  name: >
    Sucuri Security <= 1.8.33 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Sucuri Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.33. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several of its hooks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log edit/modify/delete events for themes and plugins, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

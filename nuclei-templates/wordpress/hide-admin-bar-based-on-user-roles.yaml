  name: "Hide Admin Bar Based On User Roles < 3.1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Hide Admin Bar Based On User Roles plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions before 3.1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_user_roles function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily change plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

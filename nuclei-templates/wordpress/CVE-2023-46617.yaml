  name: >
    AdFoxly – Ad Manager, AdSense Ads & Ads.txt <= 1.8.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The AdFoxly – Ad Manager, AdSense Ads & Ads.txt plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions in the ~/includes/class-adfoxly-ajax.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify several settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site's user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

info:
  name: >
    Dropshipping & Affiliation with Amazon <= 2.1.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Dropshipping & Affiliation with Amazon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation on files imported from a URL via the wpas_import_product_from_amazon() function called via an AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

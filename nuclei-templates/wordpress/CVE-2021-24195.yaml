    Login as User or Customer < 1.8 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Plugin Installation/Activation

    Low privileged users can use the AJAX action 'cp_plugins_do_button_job_later_callback' in the Login as User or Customer (User Switching) WordPress plugin before 1.8, to install any plugin (including a specific version) from the WordPress repository, as well as activate arbitrary plugin from then blog, which helps attackers install vulnerable plugins and could lead to more critical vulnerabilities like RCE.

info:
  name: >
    Product Labels For Woocommerce <= 1.5.3 - Authenticated (Shop manager+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Product Labels For Woocommerce (Sale Badges) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the â€˜'badgeLabel' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with shop manager-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

  name: >
    KBucket: Your Curated Content in WordPress <= 4.1.5 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The KBucket: Your Curated Content in WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'yt_apikey' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

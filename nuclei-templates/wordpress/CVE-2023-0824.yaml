info:
  name: >
    UserPlus <= 2.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The UserPlus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin options, including injecting malicious JavaScript into the plugin options, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This also makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute via this functionality.

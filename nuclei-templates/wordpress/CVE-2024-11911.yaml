  name: >
    WP Crowdfunding <= 2.1.12 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) WooCommerce Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Crowdfunding plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin installation due to a missing capability check on the install_woocommerce_plugin() function action in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.12. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install WooCommerce. This has a limited impact on most sites because WooCommerce is a requirement.

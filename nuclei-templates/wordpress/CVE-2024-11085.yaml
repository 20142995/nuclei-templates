    WP Log Viewer <= 1.2.1 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Log Viewer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized use of functionality due to a missing capability check on several AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to access logs, update plugin-related user settings and general plugin settings.

info:
  name: >
    Rover IDX <= 3.0.0.2905 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Authentication Bypass to Administrator
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Rover IDX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.0.0.2905. This is due to insufficient validation and capability check on the 'rover_idx_refresh_social_callback' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in to administrator. The vulnerability is partially patched in version 3.0.0.2905 and fully patched in version 3.0.0.2906.

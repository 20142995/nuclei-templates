    WP-Matomo Integration (WP-Piwik) <= 1.0.26 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP-Matomo Integration (WP-Piwik) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.26. This is due to missing nonce validation on the show() function which makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify an affected sites settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

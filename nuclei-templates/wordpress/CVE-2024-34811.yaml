    The WP SMS â€“ Messaging, SMS & MMS Notifications, 2FA & OTP for WordPress, WooCommerce, GravityForms, etc plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

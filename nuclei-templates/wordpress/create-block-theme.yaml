  name: "Create Block Theme <= 1.2.1 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The Create Block Theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing authorization via the save_local_fonts_to_theme function among others in versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."

    Spam protection, Anti-Spam, FireWall by CleanTalk <= 6.43.2 - Authorization Bypass via Reverse DNS Spoofing to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Plugin Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Spam protection, Anti-Spam, FireWall by CleanTalk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized Arbitrary Plugin Installation due to an authorization bypass via reverse DNS spoofing on the checkWithoutToken function in all versions up to, and including, 6.43.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install and activate arbitrary plugins which can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution if another vulnerable plugin is installed and activated.

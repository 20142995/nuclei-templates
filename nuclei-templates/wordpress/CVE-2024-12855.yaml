    AdForest - Classified Ads WordPress Theme <= 5.1.7 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Post/Attachment Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on several AJAX actions like 'sb_remove_ad' in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete posts, attachments and deactivate a license.

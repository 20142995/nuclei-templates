info:
  name: >
    Crafthemes Demo Import <= 3.3 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary File Upload in process_uploaded_files
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Crafthemes Demo Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'process_uploaded_files' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

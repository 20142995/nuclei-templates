    ForumWP – Forum & Discussion Board Plugin <= 2.0.2 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation via Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The ForumWP – Forum & Discussion Board Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.2 via the submit_form_handler due to missing validation on the 'user_id' user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change the email address of administrative user accounts which can then be leveraged to reset the administrative users password and gain access to their account.

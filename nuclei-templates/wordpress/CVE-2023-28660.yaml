  name: >
    Events Made Easy <= 2.3.14 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) SQL Injection via 'search_name'
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Events Made Easy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to a time-based SQL Injection via the 'search_name' parameter of the eme_recurrences_list AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 2.3.14 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

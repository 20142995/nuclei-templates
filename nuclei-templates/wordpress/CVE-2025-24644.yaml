  name: >
    WooCommerce PDF Invoices, Packing Slips, Delivery Notes and Shipping Labels <= 4.7.1 - Authenticated (Shop Manager+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WooCommerce PDF Invoices, Packing Slips, Delivery Notes and Shipping Labels plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

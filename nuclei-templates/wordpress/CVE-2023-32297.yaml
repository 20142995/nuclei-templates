info:
  name: >
    LWS Affiliation <= 2.2.6 - Unauthenticated Remote/Local File Inclusion
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The LWS Affiliation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote/Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 2.2.6 via the 'path' parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary remote code on the server, provided that allow_url_include is enabled. Local File Inclusion is also possible, albeit less useful because it requires that the attacker be able to upload a malicious php file via FTP or some other means into a directory readable by the web server.

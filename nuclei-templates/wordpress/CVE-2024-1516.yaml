    WP eCommerce <= 3.15.1 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP eCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary post creation due to a missing capability check on the check_for_saas_push() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.15.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create arbitrary posts with arbitrary content.

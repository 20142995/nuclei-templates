  name: >
    Job Manager & Career – Manage job board listings, and recruitments <= 1.4.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Job Manager & Career – Manage job board listings, and recruitments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_plugin_settings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugins settings and perform deserialization that can be leveraged for RCE via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

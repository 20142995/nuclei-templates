  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The REST API TO MiniProgram plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeovr in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.1 via the updateUserInfo() due to missing validation on the 'openid' user controlled key that determines what user will be updated.

    3DPrint <= 3.5.4.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The 3DPrint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.5.4.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on one of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files and directories, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

    WordPress Menu Plugin — Superfly Responsive Menu <= 5.0.29 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WordPress Menu Plugin — Superfly Responsive Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.29. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_handle_delete_icons() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please not the CSRF was patched in 5.0.28, however, adequate directory traversal protection wasn't introduced until 5.0.30.

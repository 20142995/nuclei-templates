  name: >
    WooCommerce Customers Manager < 30.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Customer Deletion via 'Delete'
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Customers Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to 30.1 (exclusive). This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'woocommerce-customers-manager' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete customers via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

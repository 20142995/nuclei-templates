info:
  name: >
    MyCurator Content Curation <= 3.74 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The MyCurator Content Curation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.74. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the mct_ai_logspage() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to filter and reset logs via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    WordPress Fancy Comments <= 1.2.10 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross Site Scripting via Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    WordPress Fancy Comments Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.2.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes passed to the plugin's shortcodes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

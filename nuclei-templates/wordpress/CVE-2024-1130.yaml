    NEX-Forms – Ultimate Form Builder – Contact forms and much more <= 8.5.6 - Missing Authorization via set_read()
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The NEX-Forms – Ultimate Form Builder – Contact forms and much more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the set_read() function in all versions up to, and including, 8.5.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to mark records as read.

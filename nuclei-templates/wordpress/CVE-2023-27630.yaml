  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Community by PeepSo plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 6.0.9.0 due to missing authorization checks on the action_admin_export() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger a system report export and obtain sensitive information about the servers configuration.

    Competition Form <= 2.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Competition Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Competition Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete competitions granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

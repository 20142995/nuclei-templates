  name: >
    Church Admin <= 3.4.134 - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to Plugin Backup Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Church Admin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Backup Disclosure in versions up to, and including, 3.4.134. Attackers can repeatedly request the "refresh-backup" action and simultaneously request a publicly accessible temporary file generated by the plugin in order to disclose the final backup filename.  Once obtaining that backup name, the plugin lacks sufficient protections to prevent accessing those files externally.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download the backup of the plugin's data once they conduct this attack, which requires a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

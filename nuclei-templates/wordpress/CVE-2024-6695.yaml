info:
  name: >
    User Profile Builder – Beautiful User Registration Forms, User Profiles & User Role Editor <= 3.11.8 - Authentication Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The User Profile Builder – Beautiful User Registration Forms, User Profiles & User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 3.11.8. This is due to the plugin not properly handling the user registration flow and utilizing different functionality at different stages of the process. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to login as other users granted they know the user's email address. Successful exploitation requires the user registration and the 'Automatically Log In' features (disabled by default) to be enabled.

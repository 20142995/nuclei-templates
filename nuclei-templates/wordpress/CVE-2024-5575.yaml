info:
  name: >
    Ditty – Responsive News Tickers, Sliders, and Lists <= 3.1.42 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Ditty – Responsive News Tickers, Sliders, and Lists plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the main text field in versions up to and including 3.1.42 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author access and higher, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

info:
  name: >
    Simple Giveaways <= 2.46 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Simple Giveaways plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.46. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on multiple functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save plugin settings, end giveaways and select winners among other things as subscribers via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

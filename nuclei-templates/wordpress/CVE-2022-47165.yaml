info:
  name: >
    CoSchedule <= 3.3.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The CoSchedule plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.3.8. This is due to missing nonce validation on the tm_aj_set_token function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to set the plugin's schedule token via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

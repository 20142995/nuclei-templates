  name: >
    WP Humans.txt <= 1.0.6 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Humans.txt plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.0.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator -level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

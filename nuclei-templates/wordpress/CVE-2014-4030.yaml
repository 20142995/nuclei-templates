  name: >
    JW Player for Flash & HTML5 Video < 2.1.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to player deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The JW Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the player deletion functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete the plugin's players via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

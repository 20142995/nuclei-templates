  name: "Power Zoomer <= 1.2 - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The Power Zoomer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the /js/swfupload/js/upload.php file in versions up to, and including, 1.2 This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."

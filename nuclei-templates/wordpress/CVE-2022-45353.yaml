  name: >
    Betheme <= 26.6.2 - Missing Authorization Checks to Private Page/Post Data Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Betheme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 26.6.2. This is due to a missing capability check on the mfnvb_init_vb() function that initializes the visual editor for the plugin and discloses the plugin's page builder nonces and functionality to an attacker. This makes it possible for authenticated attacks with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to trigger the Betheme page editor for any post or page and view the information along with make any changes to the post/page accessed through the editor. This CVE is specific to viewing private page data that should otherwise be restricted. This is an extension of CVE-2022-45356.

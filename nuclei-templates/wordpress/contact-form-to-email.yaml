    Contact Form Email < 1.0.1 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Contact Form Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions before 1.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

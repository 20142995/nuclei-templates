    Trade Runner <= 3.9 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Trade Runner  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 3.9. This is due to insufficient output escaping on the $google_ads_account_id variable that is displayed on the front-end on the site. This can only be exploited by site administrators on multi-site installations or installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

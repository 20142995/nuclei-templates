    WP Dashboard Notes <= 1.0.10 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Private Notes Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Dashboard Notes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the wpdn_update_note AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to modify private notes created by other users.

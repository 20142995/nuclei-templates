id: CVE-2023-7247

info:
  name: >
    Login as User or Customer <= 3.8 - Unauthenticated Limited Admin Account Compromise
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Login as User or Customer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to admin account compromise in version 3.8. This is due to the plugin not validating that the user switching back to the administrative account is the user who initiated the original login as another user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to access administrative user accounts when user switching is in progress by an administrator. Please note that this would be extremely difficult to exploit as it relies on the administrator switching to another user and the attacker knowing the admin users ID and the user ID of the user the admin switched to. It may be possible with social engineering.

id: CVE-2023-26326

info:
  name: >
    BuddyForms <= 2.7.7  - PHAR Deserialization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The BuddyForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'url' parameter in versions up to, and including 2.7.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload, however, this can easily be achieved by uploading a fake profile photo prior to launching an attack.

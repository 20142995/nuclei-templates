    WordPress Bitcoin Payments – Blockonomics <= 3.2 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WordPress Bitcoin Payments – Blockonomics plugin is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'filter_by' parameter in versions before 3.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    WPC Frequently Bought Together for WooCommerce <= 7.1.9 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WPC Frequently Bought Together for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_add_rule, ajax_add_combination, and ajax_search_term functions in versions up to, and including, 7.1.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to add rules and combinations as well as search terms.

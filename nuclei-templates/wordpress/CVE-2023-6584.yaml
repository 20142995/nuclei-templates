id: CVE-2023-6584

info:
  name: >
    WP JobSearch <= 2.3.3 - Authentication Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authenticated bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.3. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a users identity through the jobsearch_facebook_get_soc_login_url action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including administrators, as long as they have access to the email address.

    The Ultimate WordPress Toolkit – WP Extended <= 3.0.8 - Missing Authorization to Admin Username Change
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The The Ultimate WordPress Toolkit – WP Extended plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of user names due to a missing capability check on the wpext_change_admin_name() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change an admin's username to a username of their liking as long as the default 'admin' was used.

    Responsive <= 5.0.2 - Missing Authorization to HTML Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Responsive theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the save_footer_text_callback function in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary HTML content into the site's footer.

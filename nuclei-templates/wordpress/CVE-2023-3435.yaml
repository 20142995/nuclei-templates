  name: >
    User Activity Log <= 1.6.4 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The User Activity Log plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4 via the ual_export_log() and ual_export_user_log() function that is missing preparation on existing queries as well as escaping on the user input passed to them. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.  This issue was partially patched in 1.6.4, which made it only exploitable by authenticated users, a full patch was released in 1.6.5.

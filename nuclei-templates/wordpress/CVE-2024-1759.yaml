  name: >
    WP ULike <= 4.6.9 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP ULike â€“ Most Advanced WordPress Marketing Toolkit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a user's display name in all versions up to, and including, 4.6.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

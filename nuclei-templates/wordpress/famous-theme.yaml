    Famous (All Versions) - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Famous theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the /megaframe/megapanel/inc/upload.php file in all versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.

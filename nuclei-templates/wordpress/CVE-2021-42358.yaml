    Contact Form With Captcha <= 1.6.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Contact Form With Captcha WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing nonce validation in the ~/cfwc-form.php file during contact form submission, which made it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in versions up to, and including 1.6.7.

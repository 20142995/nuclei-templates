  name: "Ping List Pro <= 1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Ping List Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing nonce protection on the 'Ping_Optimizing' function in versions up to, and including 1.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and potentially inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they could trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."

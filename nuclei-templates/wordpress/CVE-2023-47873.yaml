info:
  name: >
    WP Child Theme Generator <= 1.1.2 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Child Theme Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2 due to insufficient file type checking in the wctg_custom_child_theme_process() function. This makes it possible for administrators to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

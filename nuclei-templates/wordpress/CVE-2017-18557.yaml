  name: >
    Maps by BestWebSoft <= 1.3.5 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Maps by BestWebSoft  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.3.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'category' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser granted they can trick a victim into performing an action, such as clicking on a link.

    FV Flowplayer Video Player <= 7.3.14.727 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The FV Flowplayer Video Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL injection in versions up to, and including, 7.3.14.727 in the 'email_signup' function. This makes it possible for Unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

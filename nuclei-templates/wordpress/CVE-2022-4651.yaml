info:
  name: >
    Justified Gallery <= 1.7.0 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Justified Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 1.7.0 due to insufficient sanitization and escaping on the attribute values passed through the plugins shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor level and above privileges to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

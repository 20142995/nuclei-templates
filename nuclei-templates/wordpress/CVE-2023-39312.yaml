info:
  name: >
    Avada <= 7.11.1 - Authenticated(Author+) Arbitrary File Upload via Zip Extraction
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Avada theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation when extracting zip files in the 'process_upload' and 'regenerate_icon_files' functions in versions up to, and including, 7.11.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with author permissions to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

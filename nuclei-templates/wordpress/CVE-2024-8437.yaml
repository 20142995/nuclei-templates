    WP Easy Gallery – WordPress Gallery Plugin <= 4.8.5 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Gallery Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Easy Gallery – WordPress Gallery Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on several functions hooked via AJAX like wpeg_settings and wpeg_add_gallery in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to modify galleries.

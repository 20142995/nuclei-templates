  name: >
    Yellow Yard Searchbar <= 2.7.27 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Yellow Yard Searchbar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's yy_filter and yy_filter_container shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 2.7.27 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

  name: >
    JobBoardWP â€“ Job Board Listings and Submissions <= 1.0.7 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The JobBoardWP WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters found in the ~/includes/admin/class-metabox.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.0.7. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.

  name: >
    WHMpress <= 6.2-revision-5 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WHMpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 6.2-revision-5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

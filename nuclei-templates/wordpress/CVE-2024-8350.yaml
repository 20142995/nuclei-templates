info:
  name: >
    Uncanny Groups for LearnDash <= 6.1.0.1 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Group Leader+) User Group Add
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Uncanny Groups for LearnDash plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to user group add due to a missing capability check on the /wp-json/ulgm_management/v1/add_user/ REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with group leader-level access and above, to add users to their group which ultimately allows them to leverage CVE-2024-8349 and gain admin access to the site.

    Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid <= 0.9.35 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a missing capability check on the wpvivid_upload_import_files and wpvivid_upload_files AJAX actions that allows low-level authenticated attackers to upload zip files that can be subsequently extracted. This affects versions up to, and including 0.9.35.

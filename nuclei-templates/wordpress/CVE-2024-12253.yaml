    Simple Ecommerce Shopping Cart Plugin- Sell products through Paypal <= 3.1.2 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Settings Update / Data Access
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Simple Ecommerce Shopping Cart Plugin- Sell products through Paypal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the 'save_settings', 'export_csv', and 'simpleecommcart-action' actions in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update the plugins settings and retrieve order and log data (which is also accessible to unauthenticated users).

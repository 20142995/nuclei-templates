  name: >
    WP Photo Album Plus <= 8.5.02.005 -  Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Photo Album Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 8.5.02.005 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

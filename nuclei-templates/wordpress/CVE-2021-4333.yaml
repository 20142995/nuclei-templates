    WP Statistics <= 13.1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Plugin Activation and Deactivation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Statistics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 13.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the view() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate and deactivate arbitrary plugins, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

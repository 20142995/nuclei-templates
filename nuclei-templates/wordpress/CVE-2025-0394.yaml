  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WordPress CRM, Email & Marketing Automation for WordPress | Award Winner â€” Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the gh_big_file_upload() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

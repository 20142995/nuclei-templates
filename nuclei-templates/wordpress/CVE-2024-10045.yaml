  name: >
    Transients Manager <= 2.0.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Transients Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the process_actions function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete transients via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

    Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC) <= 2.8.11 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Post Form – Registration Form – Profile Form for User Profiles – Frontend Content Forms for User Submissions (UGC) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.11. This is due to plugin not properly restricting what users have access to set the default role on registration forms. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to create a registration form with a custom role that allows them to register as administrators.

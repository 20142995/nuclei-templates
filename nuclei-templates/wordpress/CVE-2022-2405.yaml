info:
  name: >
    WP Popup Builder <= 1.2.9 - Missing Authorization and Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Popup Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.2.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation and capabilities checks on several of its functions available to unauthenticated users. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create, update, and delete popups.

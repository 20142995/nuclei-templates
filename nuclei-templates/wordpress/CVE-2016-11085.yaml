  name: >
    Quiz And Survey Master <= 4.7.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.7.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the php/qmn_options_questions_tab.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: >
    WP Customer Area <= 8.2.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Bulk Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Customer Area plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 8.2.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'cuar-trash' action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete customer files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

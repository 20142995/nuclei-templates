  name: >
    Mesmerize <= 1.6.120 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cache Clearing
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Mesmerize theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.120. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the after_setup_theme action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear the theme cache via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

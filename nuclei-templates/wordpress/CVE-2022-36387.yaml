info:
  name: >
    About Me <= 1.0.12 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The About Me plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the functions covering its AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.0.12. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to add and delete social networks.

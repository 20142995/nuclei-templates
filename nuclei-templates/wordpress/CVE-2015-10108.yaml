info:
  name: >
    Inline Google Spreadsheet Viewer <= 0.9.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Inline Google Spreadsheet Viewer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 0.9.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the vistable-proxy.php file which was converted to the maybeFetchGvizDataSource function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to import data from arbitrary locations via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

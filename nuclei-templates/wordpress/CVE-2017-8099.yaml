  name: >
    WHIZZ < 1.1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WHIZZ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to 1.1.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on several different functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete WordPress users and change the plugin's status via forged requests granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

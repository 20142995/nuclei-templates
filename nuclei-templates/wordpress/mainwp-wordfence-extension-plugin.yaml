    MainWP (Various extensions) - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    Several MainWP extensions for WordPress are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke functions normally intended for higher-privileged users such as administrators via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

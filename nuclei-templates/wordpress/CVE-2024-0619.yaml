  name: >
    Payflex Payment Gateway <= 2.5.0 - Missing Authorization to Order Status Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Payflex Payment Gateway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the payment_callback() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the status of orders, which can potentially lead to revenue loss.

    WP Courses LMS – Online Courses Builder, eLearning Courses, Courses Solution, Education Courses <= 3.2.21 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary User Meta Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Courses LMS – Online Courses Builder, eLearning Courses, Courses Solution, Education Courses plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the wpc_update_user_meta_option() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.21. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary user's metadata which can be levereged to block an administrator from accessing their site when wp_capabilities is set to 0.

info:
  name: >
    File Manager Pro <= 8.3.7 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation and capability checks in the mk_file_folder_manager AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

info:
  name: >
    Freshdesk (official) <= 2.3.6 - Open Redirect
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Freshdesk (official) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.6. This is due to insufficient validation on a redirect url. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.

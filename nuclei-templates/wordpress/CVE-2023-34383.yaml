info:
  name: >
    WP Project Manager <= 2.6.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Project Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the user task starting date in versions up to, and including, 2.6.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

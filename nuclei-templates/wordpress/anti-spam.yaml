  name: "Titan Anti-spam & Security <= 4.1 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Titan Anti-spam & Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the `antspm-q` and `antspm-e-email-url-website` parameters. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser."

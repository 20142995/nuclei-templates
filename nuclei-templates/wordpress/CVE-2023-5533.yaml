  name: >
    AI ChatBot <= 4.8.9 and 4.9.2 - Missing Authorization on AJAX actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The AI ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized use of AJAX actions due to missing capability checks on the corresponding functions in versions up to, and including, 4.8.9 as well as 4.9.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform some of those actions that were intended for higher privileged users.

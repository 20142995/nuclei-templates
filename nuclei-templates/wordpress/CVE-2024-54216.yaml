  name: >
    ARForms <= 6.4.1 - Directory Traversal to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Read
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The ARforms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file read in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to read arbitrary files on the server, which can expose DB credentials when the wp-config.php file is read.

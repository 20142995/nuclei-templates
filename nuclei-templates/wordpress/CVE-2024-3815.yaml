info:
  name: >
    Newspaper <= 12.6.5 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Attachment Meta
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Newspaper theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via attachment meta in the archive page in all versions up to, and including, 12.6.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

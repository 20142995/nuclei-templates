  name: "Right Now (Unknown Versions) - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The Right Now theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'upload_settings_image.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."

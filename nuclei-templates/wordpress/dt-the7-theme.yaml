    The7 — Website and eCommerce Builder for WordPress <= 2.1.0 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The The7 — Website and eCommerce Builder for WordPress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser.

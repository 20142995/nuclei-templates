  name: >
    All In One WP Security & Firewall <= 5.1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The All In One WP Security & Firewall plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.1.0. This is due to incorrect nonce validation on the functionsÂ 'render_login_whitelist', 'render_rename_login', 'render_honeypot' functions and possible others. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform bulk actions on the plugin's list tables (such as deleting blocked IP entries) via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.  These actions would be restricted by manipulating entries by database ID, not by other fields (such as IP address).

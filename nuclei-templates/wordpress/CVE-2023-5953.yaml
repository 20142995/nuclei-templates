  name: >
    Welcart e-Commerce <= 2.9.4 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the upload_certificate_file function in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.4. This makes it possible for subscribers or higher to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

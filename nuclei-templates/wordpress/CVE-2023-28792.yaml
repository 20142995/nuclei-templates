  name: >
    Continuous Image Carousel With Lightbox <= 1.0.15 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via search_term, order_by and order_pos
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Continuous Image Carousel With Lightbox for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the search_term, order_by and order_pos parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.0.15 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note there is not enough information to distinguish this from CVE-2023-28776.

    Post and Page Builder by BoldGrid – Visual Drag and Drop Editor <= 1.24.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via submitDefaultEditor
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Post and Page Builder by BoldGrid – Visual Drag and Drop Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.24.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the submitDefaultEditor function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the plugin's preferred editor settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

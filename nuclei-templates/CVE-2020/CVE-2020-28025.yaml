info:
  name: Exim Out-of-bounds Read Vulnerability
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: high
  description: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Out-of-bounds Read because pdkim_finish_bodyhash does not validate the relationship between sig->bodyhash.len and b->bh.len; thus, a crafted DKIM-Signature header might lead to a leak of sensitive information from process memory.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure or denial of service.
  remediation: |
    Apply the vendor-supplied patch or upgrade to a non-vulnerable version.

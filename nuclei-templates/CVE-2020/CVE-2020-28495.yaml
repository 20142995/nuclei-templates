id: CVE-2020-28495

info:
  name: Prototype Pollution in total.js
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: high
  description: |
    This affects the package total.js before 3.4.7. The set function can be used to set a value into the object according to the path. However the keys of the path being set are not properly sanitized, leading to a prototype pollution vulnerability. The impact depends on the application. In some cases it is possible to achieve Denial of service (DoS), Remote Code Execution or Property Injection.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
  remediation: |
    Update total.js to the latest version to mitigate the Prototype Pollution vulnerability.

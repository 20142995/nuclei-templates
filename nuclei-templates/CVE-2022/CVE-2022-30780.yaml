id: CVE-2022-30780

info:
  name: Lighttpd Denial of Service via Large Headers
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: high
  description: Lighttpd 1.4.56 through 1.4.58 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption from stuck connections) because connection_read_header_more in connections.c has a typo that disrupts use of multiple read operations on large headers.
  impact: |
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by sending specially crafted HTTP requests with large headers, leading to service unavailability.
  remediation: |
    Apply the vendor-supplied patch or upgrade to a non-vulnerable version to mitigate the denial of service risk.

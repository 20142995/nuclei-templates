id: CVE-2022-40895

info:
  name: NeDi User Enumeration Vulnerability
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: critical
  description: In certain Nedi products, a vulnerability in the web UI of NeDi login & Community login could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to affect the integrity of a device via a User Enumeration vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to insecure design, where a difference in forgot password utility could allow an attacker to determine if the user is valid or not, enabling a brute force attack with valid users.
  impact: |
    Successful enumeration of valid usernames can aid in further attacks such as password guessing or targeted phishing.
  remediation: |
    Implement account lockout mechanisms and ensure error messages do not reveal valid usernames.

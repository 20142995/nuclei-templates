info:
  name: Cisco Prime Infrastructure and EPN Manager XSS Vulnerability
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: medium
  description: |
    A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, leading to potential data theft or account compromise.
  remediation: |
    Apply the latest security patches provided by Cisco to mitigate the XSS vulnerability in Prime Infrastructure and EPN Manager.

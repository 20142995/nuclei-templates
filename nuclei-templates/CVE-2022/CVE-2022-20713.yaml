  description: A vulnerability in the Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN) component of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct browser-based attacks. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of input that is passed to the Clientless SSL VPN component.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct browser-based attacks, including cross-site scripting attacks, against the targeted user.

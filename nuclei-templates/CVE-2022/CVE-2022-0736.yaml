id: CVE-2022-0736

info:
  name: Insecure Temporary File in mlflow/mlflow
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: high
  description: The mlflow package is using the deprecated function tempfile.mktemp() which is not secure. This can lead to availability issues as a different process may create a file with the same name in the time between the call to mktemp() and the subsequent attempt to create the file by the first process.
  impact: |
    An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate or overwrite sensitive data stored in temporary files.
  remediation: |
    Ensure proper handling of temporary files by using secure methods and permissions.

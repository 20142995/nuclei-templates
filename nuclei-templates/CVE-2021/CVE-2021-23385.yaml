id: CVE-2021-23385

info:
  name: Flask-Security Open Redirect Vulnerability
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: medium
  description: |
    This affects all versions of package Flask-Security. When using the get_post_logout_redirect and get_post_login_redirect functions, it is possible to bypass URL validation and redirect a user to an arbitrary URL by providing multiple back slashes such as \\\evil.com/path. This vulnerability is only exploitable if an alternative WSGI server other than Werkzeug is used, or the default behaviour of Werkzeug is modified using 'autocorrect_location_header=False.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation could lead to phishing attacks or further compromise of user credentials.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade Flask-Security to a version that has patched CVE-2021-23385.

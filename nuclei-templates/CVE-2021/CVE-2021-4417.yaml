  name: >
    Forminator – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder <= 1.13.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Forminator – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.13.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the listen_for_saving_export_schedule() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export form submissions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

  name: Apache Tomcat Memory Leak DoS Vulnerability
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: high
  description: The fix for bug 63362 present in Apache Tomcat versions 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.0-M5, 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.11, 9.0.40 to 9.0.53, and 8.5.60 to 8.5.71 introduced a memory leak. The object introduced to collect metrics for HTTP upgrade connections was not released for WebSocket connections once the connection was closed. This created a memory leak that, over time, could lead to a denial of service via an OutOfMemoryError.
  impact: |
    High impact as it can lead to service unavailability.
  remediation: |

id: CVE-2021-21390

info:
  name: MinIO Signature Verification Bypass via Chunk Size
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: medium
  description: |
    In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z, there is a vulnerability which enables MITM modification of request bodies that are meant to have integrity guaranteed by chunk signatures. In a PUT request using aws-chunked encoding, MinIO ordinarily verifies signatures at the end of a chunk. This check can be skipped if the client sends a false chunk size that is much greater than the actual data sent: the server accepts and completes the request without ever reaching the end of the chunk + thereby without ever checking the chunk signature.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in MinIO.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade MinIO to version 2021-01-25 or later to mitigate the vulnerability.

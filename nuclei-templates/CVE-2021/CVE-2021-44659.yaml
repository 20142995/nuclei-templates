id: CVE-2021-44659

info:
  name: GoCD Server SSRF Vulnerability
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: critical
  description: |
    GoCD server version 21.3.0 has a functionality that could be abused to perform
    Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). NOTE: the vendor's position is that the observed
    behavior is not a vulnerability, because the product's design allows an admin to
    configure outbound requests.
  impact: |
    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to send crafted requests from the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal resources.
  remediation: |
    Apply the vendor-supplied patch or upgrade to a non-vulnerable version of GoCD Server.

id: CVE-2023-25690

info:
  name:  HTTP Request Smuggling < Apache 2.4.0 - 2.4.55 mod_proxy
  author: RosePwns
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Some mod_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack. Configurations are affected when mod_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable substitution. Note: Not sure why, but need to declare "-var Path=/the/path" in command syntax or it adds the url path twice.
  impact: |
    Allows attackers to target and access internal applications that are meant to be hidden by the reverse proxy, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or further exploitation.
  remediation: Fixed 2.4.56

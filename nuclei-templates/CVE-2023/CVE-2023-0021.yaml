id: CVE-2023-0021

info:
  name: SAP NetWeaver Reflected XSS Vulnerability
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Due to insufficient encoding of user input, SAP NetWeaver - versions 700, 701, 702, 731, 740, 750, allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject code that may expose sensitive data like user ID and password, which could lead to reflected Cross-Site scripting. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can partially impact confidentiality of the application.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser.
  remediation: |
    Apply the latest security patches provided by SAP to mitigate the reflected XSS vulnerability (CVE-2023-0021).

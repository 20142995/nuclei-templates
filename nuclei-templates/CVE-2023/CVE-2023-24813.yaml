info:
  name: Dompdf SVG Parsing URI Validation Bypass Vulnerability
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: critical
  description: |
    Dompdf is vulnerable to a URI validation bypass when parsing SVG files due to inconsistent attribute parsing between Dompdf and php-svg-lib. This can lead to arbitrary URL calls with arbitrary protocols, and in PHP versions before 8.0.0, it may lead to arbitrary unserialize, file deletion, or remote code execution.
  impact: |
    An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass URI validation and potentially execute malicious code.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade to Dompdf version 1.0.2 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.

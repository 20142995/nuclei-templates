info:
  name: JumpServer Authentication Bypass via SSH Public Key
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: high
  description: |
    JumpServer is vulnerable to an authentication bypass where an unauthenticated user can authenticate to the core API using only a username and an SSH public key without needing the corresponding private key. This can lead to unauthorized access to user information and actions.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to JumpServer resources.
  remediation: |
    Upgrade JumpServer to a version that fixes the authentication bypass vulnerability.

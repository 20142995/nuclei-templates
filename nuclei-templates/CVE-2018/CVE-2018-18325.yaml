id: CVE-2018-18325

info:
  name: DNN Weak Encryption Algorithm Vulnerability
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: high
  description: |
    DNN (aka DotNetNuke) 9.2 through 9.2.2 uses a weak encryption algorithm to protect input parameters. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-15811.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this vulnerability, upgrade to a version of DNN where the encryption algorithm has been strengthened. Ensure you are using a secure encryption algorithm such as AES-256 for all sensitive data. Regularly audit and update your encryption practices to prevent similar vulnerabilities.

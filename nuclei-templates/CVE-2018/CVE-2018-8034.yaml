info:
  name: Apache Tomcat Missing Hostname Verification
  author: ProjectDiscoveryAI
  severity: high
  description: |
    The host name verification when using TLS with the WebSocket client was 
    missing. It is now enabled by default. Versions Affected: Apache Tomcat 
    9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.9, 8.5.0 to 8.5.31, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.52, and 7.0.35 to 7.0.88.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this vulnerability, upgrade your Apache Tomcat to the latest 
    version, ensuring that hostname verification is enabled by default in TLS 
    configurations. If you are unable to upgrade, consider applying a patch to 
    specifically address the missing hostname verification issue.

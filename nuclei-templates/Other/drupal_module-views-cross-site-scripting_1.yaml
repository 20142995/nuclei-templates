  description: "This module enables you to create customized lists of data. The module doesnt sufficiently sanitize certain field types, leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a view must display a field with the format Full data (serialized) and an attacker must have the ability to store malicious markup in that field."

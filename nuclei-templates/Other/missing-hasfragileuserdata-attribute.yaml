  description: |
    The application does not explicitly define the `hasFragileUserData` attribute for managing data on shared memory in case of application uninstallation.
    The `android:hasFragileUserData` attribute, which can be defined in the AndroidManifest.xml file, specifies whether to show the user a prompt to retain data when the user uninstalls an app.
    This value should be explicitly set in the application to indicate whether the application manages important user data.
  remediation: |
    Explicitly set the `hasFragileUserData` attribute to the appropriate value:
    - true, to allow the user (via confirmation popup) to optionally keep their data in case of application uninstallation;
    - false, to force the deletion of data upon uninstallation.

    Example:

    ```xml
    <application
        android:hasFragileUserData="true"
        ... >
        ...
    </application>
    ```

evidence:
  The AndroidManifest.xml file does not explicitly define the `hasFragileUserData` attribute.

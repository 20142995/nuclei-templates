  description: "The SpamSpan module obfuscates email addresses to help prevent spambots from collecting them. This module contains a spamspan twig filter which doesnt sanitize the passed HTML string. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that sites must have custom twig template files that use the SpamSpan filter on a field that an attacker could populate. By default the SpamSpan module does not use the vulnerable twig filter."

  description: "The Consent Popup provides a configurable popup that requires acceptance of a question before the visitor can continue, typically used for age consent. The module doesnt sufficiently sanitizes the text on the block leading to a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission to create blocks."

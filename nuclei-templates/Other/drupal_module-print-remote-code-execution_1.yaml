  description: "This module provides printer-friendly versions of content, including send by e-mail and PDF versions. The module doesnt sufficiently sanitize the arguments passed to the wkhtmltopdf executable, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands. It also doesnt sufficiently sanitize the HTML content passed to dompdf, allowing a privileged attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the site must have either the wkhtmltopdf or dompdf sub-modules enabled and selected as the PDF generation tool. In the case of the dompdf vulnerability, the attacker must be able to write content to the site."

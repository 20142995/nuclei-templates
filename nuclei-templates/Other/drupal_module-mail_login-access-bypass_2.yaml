  severity: medium
  description: "This module enables users to log in by email address with minimal configurations.  Drupal core contains protection against brute force attacks via a flood control mechanism. This modules functionality did not replicate the flood control, enabling brute force attacks. A previous security advisory, SA-CONTRIB-2023-45, was released for this issue, but that release did not successfully address the vulnerability. This security advisory and updated module version supersede the previous one."

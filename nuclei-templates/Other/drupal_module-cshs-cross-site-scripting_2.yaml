  description: "The module provides a field widget for selecting taxonomy terms in a hierarchical fashion. The module doesnt sanitize user input in certain cases, leading to a possible Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with permission to create or edit taxonomy terms to which the widget may apply."

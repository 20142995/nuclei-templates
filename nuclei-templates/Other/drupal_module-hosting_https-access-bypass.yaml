  description: "Aegir is a Web hosting control panel program that provides a Drupal-based graphical interface designed to simplify deploying, managing and upgrading an entire network of Drupal, Wordpress and CiviCRM Web sites. The Hosting HTTPS module is a commonly used piece of the Aegir platform. This module doesnt sufficiently shield multi-site installations. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the server must be using Apache and must host multiple sites on a common platform. An attacker must have a knowledge about used filenames and the server."

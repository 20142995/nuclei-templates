id: CVE-2024-0550

info:
  name: anything-llm - Path Traversal and Arbitrary File Read
  author: VulnSphere
  severity: Critical
  description: |
    The anything-llm application is vulnerable to a path traversal and arbitrary file read vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the "/api/admin/user/<user_id>" endpoint, allowing them to read sensitive files on the server.

    The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation and improper handling of the "pfpFilename" parameter in the request body. By sending a specially crafted value with directory traversal sequences, an attacker can bypass intended access restrictions and read arbitrary files on the server.

  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, such as application source code, configuration files, or user data. This could potentially enable further attacks and system compromises.

  remediation: |
    - Update the application to a patched version that addresses this vulnerability.
    - Implement proper input validation and sanitization mechanisms for user-supplied data.
    - Restrict access to sensitive files and directories by following the principle of least privilege.
    - Regularly review and update the application's security posture.

  description: "This module allows users to export nodes and then import it into another Drupal installation, or on the same site. In certain cases the module doesnt sufficiently sanitize data before passing it to PHPs unserialize() function, which could results in Remote Code Execution via PHP Object Injection. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attack must operate with the permission Use PHP to import nodes, however this could be the case if this issue were combined with others in an attack chain. In general, if this module is not in active use it is recommended to disable it."

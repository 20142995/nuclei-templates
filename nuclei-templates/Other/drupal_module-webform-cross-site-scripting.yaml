  description: "This module enables you to build forms and surveys in Drupal.  The module doesnt sufficiently sanitize Webform labels nor  visibility conditions under the scenario of placing a block. When a webform block is placed and visible on a website any JavaScript code contained within the webforms label was executed. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission Edit own webform (or Edit any webform)."

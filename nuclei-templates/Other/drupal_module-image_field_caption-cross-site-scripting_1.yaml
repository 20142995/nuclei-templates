  description: "Image Field Caption (image_field_caption) adds an extra text area for captions on image fields. The module doesnt sanitize user input in certain cases, which leads to a Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The vulnerability is mitigated by several permissions, of which at least some are commonly only assigned to either editors, site builders or administrators."

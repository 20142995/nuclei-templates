  severity: medium
  description: "In certain circumstances it is possible that certain forum information is available to unprivileged users because the access check is done with node access instead of grants. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the module itself does not disclose information but only if there are listings such as views where the site builder / developer has not taken this into account."

  description: "The Coffee module helps you to navigate through the Drupal admin menus faster with a shortcut popup. The module doesnt sufficiently escape menu names when displaying them in the popup, thereby exposing a XSS vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission Administer menus and menu links."

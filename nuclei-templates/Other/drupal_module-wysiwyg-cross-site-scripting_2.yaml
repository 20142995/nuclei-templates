  description: "This module enables you to integrate various What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) rich text editors into Drupal fields with text formats allowing markup for easier editing. The module doesnt sufficiently sanitize user input before attaching a WYSIWYG editor to an input field such as a textarea. If the editor used has an XSS vulnerability this would allow for example a commenter to put specially crafted markup which could trigger the vulnerability when viewed in the editor by an administrator. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission to create content using a text format with an attached and XSS vulnerable rich text editor."

info:
  name: Android Broken TLS: Accept All Certificates
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: low
  description: |
    This template identifies instances where the application accepts all certificates, ignoring issues such as hostname mismatches. This weakens the security of TLS connections and exposes the application to man-in-the-middle attacks. For example, the use of `SSLSocketFactory.ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER` or similar configurations can make the app vulnerable to malicious interceptors.
  remediation: |
    Avoid using `ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER` or similar methods that bypass certificate validation. Implement strict certificate pinning or use `HttpsURLConnection` with a proper `HostnameVerifier` and `TrustManager` implementation to validate certificates correctly.

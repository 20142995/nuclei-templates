  description: Example Network template to send HTTPS request which times out


tcp:
  - host: 
      - "tls://{{Hostname}}"
    port: 443
    inputs:
      # noticable difference between this and net-https.yaml is that here we don't send the Connection: close header
      # and hence connection will remain open until server closes it. This can be a DOS vector in nuclei
      # as it waits for server to close the connection. now we have set a default timeout of 5 seconds and if server responds but doesn't close the connection
      # then nuclei will close connection but doesn't fail the request since we already have response data from server
      # this feature is only required for `read-all: true` to work properly
      - data: "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: {{Hostname}}\r\n\r\n"
    read-all: true

  name: CSRF Vulnerability in Paid Memberships Pro WordPress Plugin

  severity: medium
  description: |
    The Paid Memberships Pro â€“ Content Restriction, User Registration, & Paid Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.12.7.

    High impact, leading to potential account takeover or unauthorized actions.
  remediation: |

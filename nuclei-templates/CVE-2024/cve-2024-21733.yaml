  name: Apache Tomcat HTTP Request Smuggling (CVE-2024-21733)
  author: Caddyshack2175
  severity: high
  description: Apache Tomcat from 8.5.7 through 8.5.63, from 9.0.0-M11 through 9.0.43 are vulnerable to client-side de-sync attacks. Client-side de-sync (CSD) vulnerabilities occur when a web server fails to correctly process the Content-Length of POST requests. By exploiting this behavior, an attacker can force a victim's browser to de-synchronize its connection with the website, causing sensitive data to be smuggled from the server and/or client connections.
